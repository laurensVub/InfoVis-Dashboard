The action is located in fictional Liberty City. Its map is divided into three parts – each becomes available gradually, depending on the storyline progress. The player takes control of the character from the third-person view. 

The classic feature of GTA III is the ability to interact with the world: explore the map either on foot or by car, contact with other characters, visit weapon stores and shoot everywhere. Although GTA III is another chapter of the franchise, its plot is unique. 

The story begins with the dynamic bank robbery. During the heist scene, the main character (silent and unnamed for the whole game) gets betrayed by his accomplice Catalina. By good fortune, the protagonist escapes from imprisonment and starts making both ends meet in Liberty City after being deceived.

###Plot
In 2012 the last war on Earth took place. After the people defeated the corrupt government leaders, the world was rebuilt into a utopia in just twenty years. People started using the nanotechnological assemblers, which can create anything out of energy and useless objects. Even military equipment can be created.

Many cities suffer from missile attacks from an island in the southern Pacific Ocean. A spec-ops team is sent out to investigate. You are a part of it.

###Gameplay
Each mission of the game takes place near the enemy island, which is protected by all kinds of anti-air defenses. All the player's vehicles are created using the assemblers aboard a military ship and are transferred to them using a boat. The vehicles are built up with the trash the player collects on the island.

The players have three ways of controlling their units. The first way is based upon the fact that the game allows for full control of a unit with a first-person camera and simulation-style controls. The downside of this is the need to control multiple units at one time.

The second way resembles the typical real-time strategy games. The players control their units by issuing orders on a schematic map. The third way is practically the same, yet it allows for much more complex orders.",http://kiss-ltd.co.uk/,,PC,Strategy,"Singleplayer, Steam Cloud, steam-trading-cards, Sci-fi, Classic",Rage Software,"Kiss, Funbox Media, Blue Moon Red Owl",2001

Players guide Mudokon champion Abe, and his aquatic Gabbit partner Munch, in Oddworld's third adventure, using special psychic powers, cool power-ups, and other special abilities to deliver payback as they reclaim the last gabbit eggs on Oddworld, which have been packaged in a can of gabbiar.
Key features:Play as a team - players use Munch and Abe cooperatively to make their way through the trials of Oddworld. Leverage both characters' unique strengths:
Abe- Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, and then run to escape from dangerous enemies. When all else fails, chant to take control of the enemy's soul, and use their guns to clear a path to safety.
Munch - Munch can swim around the new realms of Oddworld. When on the ground, zip along with a wheelchair power up. Need to move some yapping Slogs out of the way? Just use Munch's nifty remote control head port to fire up the crane and drop those Sloggies in their pen.
Special psychic powers - Munch and Abe's psychic powers can extend their reach and get others to do the dirty work:
As Abe - Let Abe's chant roar to take possession of a gun-toting Big Bro Slig and clear almost anything out of the way. Abe can use spooce or spiritual power gained byharvesting SpooceShrubs to posses other creatures as well, but why think small?
As Munch - If Abe can't mesmerize someone into getting the job done, Munch can use his handy remote control head port to hijack nearby machines including cranes, and 50-caliber Anesthesia bots to tackle the really tough obstacles.
Power-Ups – Every friendly character you can find becomes a fighting ally, Fuzzles, Mudokons…. Need to get somewhere quickly or get over a wall, like right now? Use Oddworld's consumer power-ups like Expresso and Bounce to amp up Munch and Abe's abilities to perform cool moves. For the more direct approach, possess high-caliber weapon toting enemies.
Oddworld, now in ""new and improved 3D!"" - it's a whole new Oddworld, with lush rivers, towering mountains and hundreds of trees that bloom or die.

Your hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol makes a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin, and function with the Covenant on their heels. Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.

Halo: Combat Evolved is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.

Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on backup. There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.

Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item that is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.

One of the most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single-player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies. Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.

Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/,,"PC, Xbox, macOS","Action, Shooter","combat, secrets, alien",Bungie,Microsoft Studios,2001

Pokkle loves making terrible puns and wears a tail for funsies, and Pipiro loves buying fashionable clothes and has no filter whatsoever. Together, they meander through what seems to be a peaceful, monotonous existence in their sleepy little burg where nothing interesting ever happens.
Until something does, anyway! A mysterious masked figure shows up one night and steals six holy idols from the local shrine. The self-proclaimed “Archduke of Arges” tenders a hefty reward for their return, and our “brave” duo jumps at the chance to go find them – Pokkle for the glory, and Pipiro strictly for the cash moneys.
Their journey will take them to every last nook and cranny across the land and lead to confrontations with a wide variety of friends and foes, each more ludicrous than the last, as a sinister plot to revive an ancient “Demon Lord” unfolds and 500 years’ worth of history comes into focus. Can two 14-year-olds with limited abilities and almost no social skills truly save the day? Or is Arges just pretty much screwed?
Released in Japan simply as Zwei!!, Zwei: The Arges Adventure is the direct predecessor to the previously released Nihon Falcom action RPG Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection, from the creators of the popular Ys and The Legend of Heroes franchises.
Boasting a completely standalone story set on a mysterious “low fantasy” island floating amongst the clouds, Zwei: The Arges Adventure plays out as a classically styled action-oriented 2D dungeon crawler with oodles of optional content and unlockables, player-defined challenge through a unique food-based experience system, and a pervading tongue-in-cheek humor style that helps set it apart from other entries in the genre. Although released on several different platforms in Japan over the years, this is the first time it’s ever been officially released in English, and is the most feature-complete version of the game to date.
So what are you waiting for? There’s no need to ask Zwei; you Arges gonna have to play this game right now!FEATURESSD Anime-Style Characters Inhabiting a Colorful Hand-Drawn 2D World
Boasting beautiful painterly art rife with detail and animations, and populated with an equally colorful cast of super-deformed anime characters who are constantly on the move, the world of Arges feels perpetually alive and energetic.
Fast and Chaotic Combat Featuring a Plucky Duo of Protagonists (and One Pet)
Fend off merciless enemies in real time with Pokkle’s melee attacks and Pipiro’s myriad magics, and solve puzzles to progress through the game’s many dungeons, all while either flanked by a loyal pet or while monitoring said pet from afar as it goes off on its own adorable little journeys.
Tongue-in-Cheek Story and Characters Providing Genuine Humor
Pokkle’s terrible puns and Pipiro’s all-encompassing snark combine with quirky NPCs, self-aware dialogue, weird and unlikely locations, over-the-top situations, fourth-wall breaking, optional side-quests, and more to provide a genuinely funny and dynamic RPG experience.
Food-Based Leveling System Allowing Players to Challenge the Game on Their Own Terms
Eat food to level-up, or hoard your food so you can exchange it in town for even better food down the line that grants even more experience. Will you stay low-level and challenge dungeons well beyond your means for the promise of more level-ups to come, or will you engorge yourself on demand to make the road ahead a little easier?
Minigames, Music, Achievements, Art, and More, Creating the Definitive Zwei Experience
Play an Ys-inspired typing tutor, an adorable yet savage aeroplane shmup, or a block puzzler that rewards you for not making combos – or maybe just take the time to help guide your pet through the harsh wilderness for various spoils! If that’s not enough, why not try for one of the myriad new achievements, seek out one of the newly illustrated character bromides, or switch out the regular soundtrack for its 2008 arranged version?

It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001 in Japan, and has since been ported to multiple platforms. The Nintendo DS version, titled Gyakuten Saiban Yomigaeru Gyakuten in Japan, was released in 2005 in Japan and North America, and in 2006 in Europe, and includes an English language option. The game is the first entry in the Ace Attorney series, and has received several sequels and spin-offs.
The story follows Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who attempts to get his clients declared ""not guilty"". Among other characters are Phoenix's boss, Mia Fey; his assistant and Mia's sister, Maya; and prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. The player controls Phoenix through two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials. During investigations, they gather information and evidence, and during trials, they cross-examine witnesses and answer questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and the witnesses. The story is split into five cases, the fifth being introduced in the Nintendo DS version to take advantage of gameplay elements using the handheld's touchscreen and not available in the original Game Boy Advance version.
Development of the game was handled by a team of seven people over the course of ten months. It was directed and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version of the game takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.
The game has been mostly positively received by critics, who have appreciated its premise, writing, characters and presentation. The game has been a commercial success both in Japan and internationally, with the North American release selling higher than expectations and being hard to find in stores shortly after release. Other media based on the game has been made: a manga series premiered in 2006; a film adaptation of the game, titled Ace Attorney, premiered in 2012; and an anime series adaptation started airing in 2016.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/,"iOS, PC, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo DS, Wii, Android, Game Boy Advance",Adventure,"Visual Novel, Single player only","Capcom, Capcom Production Studio 4",Capcom,2001

It is the second game in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the 1999 release of the original game. It was released in Japan and North America in 2001, and in Europe and Australia in 2002.
The game features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from these franchises as well. Melee includes all playable characters from the first game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also adds characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. Melee's gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and is one of the most popular fighting games for competitive play.
The game received critical praise, as well as awards and acknowledgements from gaming publications.

The game type is visual novel + war chess game.
It is like a painting with symmetrical composition, presenting a dystopian world of black and white.
""Black & White"" has more than 250,000 words of game text.
This is a ""not dystopian"" dystopian story.
Players will observe the memories of the twelve main characters as they are observing, and continue to communicate with the mysterious girl.
- ""The opposite of justice is not evil, but another kind of justice.""
This sentence is the most crucial theme of ""Black & White"".
In the world of Black & White, you can trust the White Church camp that symbolizes order, fairness, and reason.
You can also identify with the Black Cinder Crow camp, which symbolizes freedom, culture, and sensibility.
On one side are priests with white hair, possessed by insects, and different personalities.
On one side are historical figures who have returned from the dead, died tragically, and are romantic. How would you choose?
The art style of ""Black & White"" is extremely unique, and all the UI and characters in the game present a contradictory intention.
There are nearly 100 characters and more than 400 CG or story maps in the game.
We not only carefully sculpted the vertical paintings and CGs of each character with an extremely serious attitude.
A branch plot is also set up for each of the twelve characters, and the branch plot will present a large number of story maps in a manner similar to comic interpretation.
Compared with our previous work, ""Black & Whitef"" has optimized the animation. While ensuring high-quality static art, some art can be animated and lifelike, which can make players feel better. Enter this world!
We also put a lot of effort into this game in terms of sound, and strive to achieve the top level of domestic two-dimensional games.
Lin Fangzhou, Harper, Xu Luyang and other three composers are mainly responsible for the soundtrack of """", and the sound effects are also produced by special sound engineers, who will control every link.
The dubbing director of ""Black & White"" is Mr. Mori Zhongren, and the dubbing actors have invited Hanser, Tao Dian, and many dubbing actors from Yuesheng Dubbing Club to cooperate.
There are a large number of turn-based war chess level elements in ""Black & White"".
We hope that through the war chess level, people can be more immersed in the characters and worldview, understand the plot, and at the same time, we hope to bring more fun to players who like war chess.
There are more than 30 level maps in the game, including moving in subways, wilderness, urban areas and other venues.
In the first half of the game, players need to constantly unlock the character story, and at the same time clear the less difficult and guiding story levels.
In the second half of the game, after players collect 12 characters, players can freely assign characters to form a team, clear 28 challenge levels, and unlock more follow-up plots and game achievements in the challenge levels.

It is the first video game to implement the real time application of the new rules. It is also the first game in the Baldur's Gate series released on consoles as opposed to a PC and/or Mac.
Dark Alliance was well received on all four platforms, with the PlayStation 2 version going on to win the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for ""Role-Playing Game of the Year"" (2001). A sequel, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, was released in 2004 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

It was directed, produced and written by Yu Suzuki. Like the original Shenmue, Shenmue II consists of open-world environments interspersed with brawler battles and quick time events. It features a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules, and various minigames. The player controls the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he arrives in Hong Kong in 1987 in pursuit of his father's killer. His journey takes him to Kowloon and the mountains of Guilin, where he meets a young woman who is part of his destiny.
Some of Shenmue II was developed alongside the original Shenmue, which was the most expensive video game ever developed at the time. The Dreamcast version was only released in Japan and Europe; Microsoft secured console exclusivity in North America for Shenmue II, and released an enhanced port for the Xbox console in 2002 and other territories in 2003.
The Dreamcast version of Shenmue II received positive reviews, but reviews for the Xbox port were mixed; it has since appeared in several ""greatest video games of all time"" lists. Shenmue II sold poorly and further games in the series entered a period of development hell lasting over a decade. In 2015, Suzuki and his company Ys Net began developing Shenmue III for Windows and PlayStation 4 following a successful crowdfunding campaign.",,,"PC, Xbox, Dreamcast","Action, Adventure, RPG",Singleplayer,SEGA,"Microsoft Studios, SEGA",2001

As part of the Conker video game series, the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a greedy, heavy-drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.
Although visually similar to Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day was designed for mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed over the course of four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.
Upon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its visual appeal and smart, funny humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a cult following due to its unique styling. A remake, Conker: Live & Reloaded, was released for the Xbox in 2005.

It was the first game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise to be released on a Nintendo platform. The story follows Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy as they journey to stop Doctor Eggman from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each level, defeating Eggman and his robot army, and collecting the seven Chaos Emeralds.
Development began after Sega shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the Dreamcast console. The company recruited Dimps to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While Sonic Advance follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure (1998). The game has been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console.
Sonic Advance received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and compared it favorably to the original Genesis games. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the GBA's best-selling titles. Dimps has since created many entries in the series, including two sequels to the game, Sonic Advance 2 (2002) and Sonic Advance 3 (2004).",,,"Wii U, Android, Game Boy Advance","Action, Platformer","Singleplayer, Multiplayer","Sonic Team, DIMPS","SEGA, THQ, Infogrames",2001

The objective of the game is to win all the provided races, championships, complete license tests and achieve 100% game completion. Every 25% of the game completed results in the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3, the Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American version) has a reorganized layout, with a more structured and progressive arrangement of races and challenges. Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops are now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.

The Arcade Mode is reorganized in ""stages""; these stages are made up of 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all available tracks in the game, including both road and rally races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must be completed on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the stage on Normal or Difficult, additional cars are unlocked as well for play in any mode of Arcade Mode (including two-player battle and time trial).

GT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse variants' and 4 of which are dirt tracks. Most of these circuits are at fictional locations, but California's Laguna Seca Raceway and Côte d’Azur (which is heavily based on the Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.

Other changes include the omission of the ability to ""race modify"" or add downforce to production cars, removal of suspension damage, and the absence of torque limits for races.

New to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed versions of six actual Formula One cars, labelled as F686/M, F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S (in the Japanese and American versions) that the player could win from endurance races. In the Japanese and American versions, the name of each car denotes various pieces of information (such as the amount of cylinders in the engine, the year the chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For example, the a forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, 1994-season car driven by Ayrton Senna, whereas the F686/M represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by Nigel Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 cars, not obviously based on any real-life counterparts and instead labelled as Polyphony 001 and 002 respectively.

GT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers Lamborghini and Porsche. A racing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car has been cut from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a cheat device), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game code (though it cannot be obtained normally, and requires the use of a cheat device). Both cars, together with two hidden Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however, are completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its first official appearance in 2009's Gran Turismo (PSP), while Porsche made its first official appearance in Gran Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4.",,,PlayStation 2,Racing,"exclusive, true exclusive",,,2001

Initially released in Japan in April 1993, the game was later made available in North America in August 1994 by Square Soft, who handled the title's English localization and promotion.
Recognized by Capcom as their first traditional role-playing video game, Breath of Fire would set the precedent for future entries in the series, and features character designs artist Keiji Inafune, as well as music by members of Capcom's in-house sound team Alph Lyla. In 2001, the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance handheld system with new save features and minor graphical enhancements, with the English version being released in Europe for the first time. In 2016, it was released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.
Set in a fantasy world, Breath of Fire follows the journey of a boy named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of an ancient race with the ability to transform into mighty dragons, as he searches the world for his sister. During his quest, Ryu meets other warriors who share his quest, and comes into conflict with the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire who seeks to take over the world by reviving a mad goddess.

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console.
Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.
Super Monkey Ball received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme as well as the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, Super Monkey Ball 2, and an entire Super Monkey Ball franchise.",,,GameCube,,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Amusement Vision,SEGA,2001

It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.
Aspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or ""Ratio"") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game.

Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the ""Dream Spirit"", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.

But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.",,,PlayStation 2,"Action, Adventure, Platformer","exclusive, true exclusive",NAMCO,Namco,2001

​ JUST LIKE FINDING THE MARY CELESTE
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
It is the year 2083. Ten months ago, the first humans landed on Argilus. They found cities, towns, industrial installations - all deserted. Doors unlocked. Meals unfinished. Amazing machinery still working. But no people.
It was like finding the Mary Celeste on a planetary scale.
​ LIVING SHIPS, FLOATING CITIES, A FASCINATING MYSTERY
Science teams were brought in, research bases set up. Four months later, your supply ship has been sent to check on these bases. But when you hail them from orbit, there's no answer. The science teams, too, seem to have vanished.
Now your systems are failing and you and your crewmate have no choice but to abandon ship. But where can you go? Where else?
SCHIZM: MYSTERIOUS JOURNEY is a thrilling First Contact adventure where you play both members of the Earth supply vessel Angel as you explore the fascinating landscape of an alien world filled with mystery and intrigue
.
On 4 December 1872, the 103-foot brigantine Mary Celeste was discovered drifting abandoned in the Atlantic 590 miles west of Gibraltar. The captain's log and the crew's personal effects were found on board. The cargo was intact. There was an unfinished letter on the mate's desk, the imprint of a child's head on a pillow on one of the bunks. To this day, no one knows what became of the captain, his family and the crew of seven.
When the first humans landed on Argilus on 24 June 2083, they found towns, cities, evidence of fascinating alien technology, but all abandoned, with clear signs that the inhabitants had only just departed. Doors were unlocked, meals unfinished. Amazing machinery was still working away. But no people. It was like discovering the Mary Celeste on a planetary scale.
Earth Central wanted answers. The planet was classified Restricted and put under immediate quarantine. Experts were sent in. Three science teams - nearly a hundred of Earth's finest first contact specialists - set up science and monitoring outposts at three promising locations: Base One at Bosh's Tunnels, under Dr Angela Davies, Base Two at Symphony Harbor, under Dr Gustav Tomlin, and Base Three at Rainbow Landing, under Dr Frances Bremmer.
Because of a particularly active planetary magnetosphere, the surface teams found it impossible to contact Earth directly. Though able to make limited radio contact with one another, the constant electromagnetic interference in the atmosphere prevented messages being routed through the orbital beacon in the usual manner. At first, eager mission leaders could use shuttles to return to the orbiting expedition base ship, Tarquin, and broadcast from there, but twenty days after the expedition's arrival, Tarquin fell silent and vanished from surface radar scans. It had either left the area or - an alarming prospect - had been destroyed in orbit. The teams on Argilus were effectively cut off from Earth.
That was just the beginning. Scientists began to go missing. One by one, wherever they were working, alone or in company, personnel at all three bases started disappearing. Was it something they touched, some device they activated, some secret they discovered? No one could say. Every day, the survivors were faced with the nightmare of discovering who had vanished this time, and were left frantically, desperately, uselessly seeking answers.
Now, four months later, the mission supply ship Angel approaches Argilus to make the first follow-up contact, but its crew - experienced spacers and xeno specialists Sam Mainey and Hannah Grant - can't raise any response from the planetary bases. There is no sign at all of the expedition mothership.
Knowing that communication from the surface is difficult, and following special ECS mission directives, Captain Mainey takes Angel into a much closer orbit than usual, to where Angel's enhanced com systems should be able to raise someone. There's still no response. Bounceback signatures are positive. Com systems seem to be online and operational, but no-one answers. It's as if the Earth science teams have simply vanished.
Sam and Hannah know what they must do. Given the circumstances, standard ECS procedure is to abort the landing, withdraw to a safe distance and await instructions. But the moment they try to pull back to where they can notify Earth of what has happened, Angel's main systems fail. Com and engines are out. Life support is falling to critical. The ship's orbit is beginning to decay.
Sam Mainey and Hannah Grant have no choice but to use the life-pods and abandon ship, even though they have not yet received the classified 902 mission briefing they were meant to get once contact with the scientists had been made.
​ STRANGE NEW WORLD
Though Sam and Hannah agree to rendezvous at Base One, and adjust their life-pods' comp systems accordingly, weather and electromagnetic variables cause them to land quite some distance from each other, so their first exposure to the new world finds them on their own.
Hannah lands on a fascinating living ship adrift in the middle of the Great Northern Ocean, and Sam on one of a cluster of balloons floating high above one of the continents. Though their radio links are operational, they both quickly find that the atmospheric interference makes communication impossible. They set their links on record, both as a routine mission log for those back home and in case their missing crewmate can access the data later. Then, with no other choice, they begin exploring this strange new world.
With Sam and Hannah, you will experience every step of this fascinating journey of discovery, face their problems, share their successes and disappointments. With luck and skill, you might even unlock the ultimate mystery of Argilus.
ONLY YOU CAN UNLOCK THE SECRET!

It is based loosely on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The game's Japanese title is simply Saiyūki (西遊記), which is the Japanese name of Journey to the West.
It follows the basic outline of the plot of the novel, in which the main character, a Buddhist practitioner named Sanzo, travels from China to India on a religious mission and has a variety of adventures along the way. The game also features several other characters from the novel, including Son Goku, the monkey king. In contrast to other renditions of the story, the game allows Sanzo to be played as either a male or a female character at the player's choice.
A gameplay twist is that every character except Sanzo can transform into a monstrous form for a limited time. Instead of transforming, Sanzo has access to summon spells that each boost the party's stats in different ways for a number of rounds and allows him/her to use an extra spell at will. Furthermore, each character has a native element that powers their spells and weakens them to opposing elements.
The game softens the original story, with most of the heroes' negative characteristics removed, and most of the villains surviving at the end.
The game's plot are heavily based between Buddhism and Hinduism. Buddhism is the main religion in this game where Sanzo and his party member must save Buddha, while gods from Hinduism are the main antagonists.",,,PlayStation,"RPG, Strategy","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Controller, exclusive, friends, console, memory","Sony Interactive Entertainment, KOEI",Koei,2001

It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man X series and is a follow-up to Mega Man Xtreme, released the previous year. Mega Man Xtreme 2 takes place during the 22nd century, in an unknown year 21XX, between the events of Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4. The DNA souls of robots known as ""Reploids"" all around the world are being stolen by a pair of villains in order to create an army of undead ""Mavericks"". The ""Maverick Hunters"" Mega Man X and Zero quickly spring into action, now with the help of their young ally Iris.
Mega Man Xtreme 2 is a similar take on the series action and platforming gameplay formula while combining elements from home console versions of the Mega Man X series. The player may choose to play each of a series of stages as either protagonist, X or Zero. Defeating the stage's boss will earn that player character its special weapon. Critical reception for Mega Man Xtreme 2 was lightly positive, with most reviewers giving the game praise typical of the long-running series and noting a general improvement over the first Mega Man Xtreme title. In 2013, Mega Man Xtreme 2 was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American eShop the following year and was released in the PAL region eShop in September 11, 2014.",,,Game Boy Color,"Action, Platformer",Singleplayer,Capcom,Capcom,2001

510032,serious-sam-palm,Serious Sam: Palm,2001-12-13,,3.14,7,0,15,0,0,"First-person shooter game in the Serious Sam series that was released for the Palm OS. It was released in December 2001 and was published by Global Star Software, now known as Take-Two Interactive. 

   The Palm OS version is a greatly-scaled down version of Serious Sam: The First Encounter, at least technology-wise. Level architecture bears a resemblance to that of Wolfenstein 3D, as they appear to be very blocky. Several enemies and weapons from TFE appear in the game. As with TFE, the player could obtain score by killing enemies, and there appears that one's high score appears on the center-top of the screen, in order to give them a goal to suppress.

The graphics are very primitive compared to The First Encounter: enemies, items and weapons are 2D sprites instead of models, there are few special effects (rare animated wall textures), and levels are built out of just cubes. This is understandable, as the Palm OS version made in 2001 comes nowhere near the capabilities of even a weak PC would be in 2001.

It can be played in both color and monochrome mode, depending on one's Palm OS hardware and installed package version included on the disc used to distribute the game.


   Игра, эксклюзивно выпущенная на платформу PalmOS.

   Данная версия игры, более походит на Первое пришествие. Однако, в связи со слабыми техническими характеристиками, не стоило ожидать бестселлера - Serious Sam Palm OS является лишь грубо переработанным материалом шедевра. Игра сильно пострадала не только в графическом, но и в музыкальном и техническом аспекте. Но, опять же, иная развязка с учётом возможностей КПК тех лет - неизбежна. Всего, предусмотрено 15 уровней, которые внешне будут походить на Wolfenstein 3D's' или же DOOM - все этапы как бы ""сложены из кубиков"" и имеют однотипную архитектуру, которая отличается лишь расцветкой.

Each city comes with its own wide variety of buildings - will you manage to own them all, including the super-rare landmarks?

MAKE GREAT DEALS IN THE AUCTION HOUSE TO GAIN REAL ESTATE POWER
There is no such thing as a free lunch… If you really want a property and establish a local monopoly, you will have to compete against other players - play well and you will get the best properties at the lowest prices, but if you bid too low these properties will make a competitor happy.

COMPLETE ALL CITIES AND BECOME THE ULTIMATE REAL ESTATE TYCOON!

Campaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the Moon.
Campaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent.
Campaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars.
Each campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty. All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first. There is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the Moon or asteroid.
The game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed. Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain.

The game featured a complicated development and initial release period, with the company receiving legal pressure multiple times from Nintendo, who felt that the game's very similar gameplay and presentation, which also featured the art of Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 artist Mayumi Hirota, infringed on their copyrights on their Fire Emblem intellectual property. Direct ties to Fire Emblem were dropped, and its original title, Emblem Saga, was changed to its final title as to not sound so similar to Fire Emblem, and the game was released in Japan on May 24, 2001, by Enterbrain, for Nintendo's competitor, Sony, on their PlayStation console. Three months after release, Nintendo took them to court over the game, and while Enterbrain was ordered to pay a fee, they ultimately retained the right to sell the game.
The game was viewed as a success, selling over 345,000 copies in its first three months of sale in Japan. The game was never released in any other regions officially, though a rough unofficial fan translation was created and released over a decade later in 2012, with a full translation being released on November 22, 2016.

The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki, a traveling showman searching for the ""girl in the sky"". He arrives in a quiet, seaside town where he meets three girls, one of whom is the key to the end of his journey.
The gameplay in Air follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the player character. The game is divided into three segments—Dream, Summer, and Air—which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Air has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.
Following the game's release, Air made several transitions into other media. A manga by Yukimaru Katsura was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq, and later published into two volumes.

It is a spin-off entry in the Star Ocean series, acting as a direct sequel to the 1998 PlayStation title Star Ocean: The Second Story. It was later remade for mobile devices, releasing in 2009.
Blue Sphere is set two years after the events of The Second Story on the planet Edifice, a world currently in a pre-space flight state but holding remnants of an advance civilization. Protagonists from the events of The Second Story are brought down onto the planet by an unknown force, and must work to discover its source and leave. The gameplay carries over multiple Star Ocean elements, including real-time combat and optional side conversations between party members. New elements include item creation tied to the skill system, and local multiplayer options unlock through the Game Link Cable.
Development began in 2000 as a spin-off from the main Star Ocean series, taking approximately one year to complete. Multiple core staff from earlier Star Ocean titles returned, including series composer Motoi Sakuraba. The character designs were created by manga artist Mayumi Azuma. The production period proved difficult for the team, with the programmers collapsing from exhaustion. In addition to tri-Ace, developer tri-Crescendo helped with the sound design.

The theme song for the game is ""Sweet Home Alabama"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is the fifth game in the NASCAR series of video games, and is the first of the series to have a new title (the other games simply read ""NASCAR"", followed by the year). Notably, it is the first NASCAR game to feature alternate paint schemes on the cars. It featured the 2001 Cup Series Champion Jeff Gordon on its cover and 2000 Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte on the disc.
NASCAR Thunder 2002 was the first NASCAR game released for the Xbox and the second released for the PlayStation 2. Game modes consist of Create-a-car, Quick race, Season mode, Career mode, and practice. Before every race, the player has the option to qualify for a position at the start of the race, get to know the track in practice, or 'race' other cars in Happy Hour. The game has 35 drivers from the 2001 Winston Cup season (minus Dale Earnhardt due to his death, but the game has many tributes to him including a black No. 3 screen on start-up) and several then-Busch Series and fantasy drivers that can be unlocked.
The PlayStation version was separate from the PS2 and Xbox versions, included only 36 drivers, and included an instant-replay feature, fantasy tracks, and only 18 drivers per race, and all of the alternate paint schemes were removed. A system of power-up/cheat cards and challenges, similar to Chase/Thunder plates and Lightning/Dodge Challenges in later editions, was a major game mode in this version.",,,"PlayStation 2, PlayStation, Xbox",Racing,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Electronic Arts Tiburon,Electronic Arts,2001

A launch title for the Game Boy Advance portable game console, it was released in North America on May 29, 2001 and in Europe on September 21 the same year. Influenced by the Commodore 64 game Uridium, the game features a single starship fighting the alien Iridion, who have attacked Earth. Iridion spans seven levels from Earth to the aliens' home planet, each with a fixed linear path that ends with a boss.
Iridion began development as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, Iridion was the first game by the developer to appear on the system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and resizing to manipulate the size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment. More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.
On release Iridion garnered generally poor reviews. The graphics and sound were generally praised; even a year after its release, critics at TechTV considered it the best-looking game on the platform. In contrast, critics derided the game's repetitive and frustrating gameplay. Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release, Iridion 3D influenced future Shin'en shooters such as Iridion II and Nanostray.",,,"PC, Game Boy Advance","Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","Shin'en Multimedia, Piko Interactive, Shin'en","Majesco Entertainment, Piko Interactive",2001

Beyblade: Let it Rip! is a tournament style game with very little roleplay elements. It consists of two modes: Tournament mode, and Free Battle. Tournament mode is the game's story mode, and features 11 matches. Free Battle allows players to battle as or against the characters from the Beyblade anime, or custom characters that are saved to the Memory Card.

The gameplay is very similar to the Nintendo GameCube game Beyblade: V-Force: Super Tournament Battle. However, there are no hidden unlockable characters in Beyblade: Let it Rip!.

Players can also customize the custom character's Beyblade in Customize mode.",,,PlayStation,Strategy,"Story, battle, character, memory, japan, metal",Takara,Crave Entertainment,2001

Lehat's forehead had something like a bruise by nature, but he had kept it hidden for a long time at the behest of his mother.

29608,art-is-dead,Art Is Dead,2001-02-01,,0.0,1,0,5,0,0,"Art is dead is a 2D top-down shooter that redefines the idea of AI enemies. In this game, walls are your enemy. You can't hide behind them, you can't use them to your advantage, and your bullets can't pass through them. Meanwhile, enemies can move freely through the map and they will chase you to your death. No matter how deep you are into the game, one stupid mistake can end your kill spree abruptly, so be careful and never underestimate your enemies. In addition to this, there's a deep lore behind the game explained in a very easy way, so you don't have to read long texts or memorize multiple names, just enjoy the way everything unfolds.
Enemies are optimized to make your life there miserable. If you think you are fast enough, a new soul will approach you with terrifying speed while dodging your useless bullets. If you think your weapons are strong enough, a new soul will appear in the darkness, coming to you slowly but resisting all your damage. If you think you have everything under control, which you should never do, your surroundings will become the playground of a sneaky soul only visible through your lantern. All of them will tear you apart in seconds, so you better get away from them and think fast. These are not the only enemies there are, so don't get cocky and learn from all their movements.
The game has two main modes:
- Ego chamber: If you want to understand the lore of the game, this is where you should go. It can be done in a very short amount of time, but it's very challenging and can become frustrating at times. Each level works as a checkpoint, but be aware of every trick the joker soul tries to pull on you. You can lose all your progress if you are not careful and be forced to start the Ego chamber from the start. The more you advance, the more things you'll understand, and the more challenging enemies will become.
- Survival: Just to have fun and break scores. Make use of the best weapons, the best strategies, and the best equipment so you can last the most rounds possible. Just try not to break all the lights, you'll miss them on late rounds. You can choose from 2 different maps. Survival Corridor is composed of 27 rounds designed manually to make the experience there frustrating and difficult. You'll need to explore the map in search of better equipment and not get trapped in narrow corridors. Combat Arena on the other hand is very easy to explore, and rounds are randomly generated. If you have the patience and skills to get to round 100, that's a win, but I doubt you are capable of that.
**************************************************************************
Although this description may sound a little serious, the game has a very defined sense of humor. For every achievement you complete, a new skin will be unlocked so you can be more stylish while killing tormented souls. Some of them have a very rough sense of humor, while others are just cute, fun, or related to other products of Darkhunter Studios.
So, what are you waiting for? For the price of a Happy Meal, you can hold the power to execute indiscriminate genocide on poor little sad souls. If you ask me, it's a safe bet.
We are thinking of adding multiplayer to the game, which would increase a lot the hours of entertainment. If we see a good reception from the players, we will start with the development and you will be able to enjoy the game with your friends in less than a week. You know what people say, genocide with friends tastes way better",http://www.smallrockets.com/pc/artisdead/,,PC,"Action, Arcade, Casual, Indie","Singleplayer, Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Story Rich, 2D, Funny, Steam Leaderboards, Comedy, Pixel Graphics, Dark, Mystery, combat, Multiple Endings, Top-Down, Dungeon Crawler, Dark Humor, Demons, Minimalist, Arena Shooter, Score Attack, Арена-шутер","Small Rockets, Darkhunter Studios","Real Networks, Darkhunter Studios",2001

(建設重機喧嘩バトル ぶちギレ金剛!!), is a non-traditional fighting video game for the PlayStation 2 game console, where the player must battle in various construction vehicles.

The game was only released in Europe and Japan. It was also one of the first PlayStation 2 titles to be released in DVD-ROM format, rather than CD-ROM as most early PS2 titles were.[citation needed]. The story in this game revolves around the player settling construction site contracts through vehicular combat with various rival companies. The player uses vehicles commonly found on construction sites like diggers and bulldozers. The game also contains a romantic subplot involving the players step-sister.

A quick aside…this game was the one that got really popular back in the day and helped me to get better known in the GM community…shortly thereafter the GM Community was founded by a group of us but was ultimately taken down. SUV 2 bombed as well, and lessons were learned the tough way…

In the game, players use armored vehicles to fight battles staged in arenas. Players could choose which side they wished to fight for, the aliens or the humans, and could also choose one of three different vehicles; each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although the game was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could play. Players move around the arena attempting to shoot each other, while also looking for power-ups for their vehicles. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. If a player was killed while playing the game, they simply respawn.
Alien Front Online was originally slated for release in Japan, but was cancelled. A related game, simply titled Alien Front, was announced by Sega for the N-Gage in 2004, but was eventually canceled.
The game was brought back online by fans through private servers in 2016",,,Dreamcast,Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer","SEGA, Wow Entertainment",SEGA,2001

It was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance, and was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, in North America on June 11, 2001, and in Europe on June 22, 2001. The game's sequel, GT Advance 2: Rally Racing, was released on June 30, 2002 in North America.
GT Advance features forty-five Japanese cars and places the player in races on thirty-two tracks. Due to positive reaction to the game in Japan, THQ purchased publishing rights for the North American and European releases to the game after a reported bidding war, and added in a controversial password save system into the game to cut costs.
The game was received with mostly positive reviews from critics that praised the game for its fun gameplay, but THQ was criticized by most reviewers for adding passwords to the game when the Japanese version had battery-backed saves.",,,Game Boy Advance,Racing,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive, true exclusive",MTO,THQ,2001

A cooperative effort between scientific agencies and military forces has led to the creation of  a safe haven for a precious few lives. This mission is known as 'Project Atoll', and is intended to ensure the survival of the human race beyond this cataclysmic event.
As a scientific researcher and explorer you have survived the first impact event by submerging deep into the ocean depths in a single person craft. However, your supply of food and water has run low and you are now forced to attempt to make your way back to the ocean surface, but you must first harvest the power needed to do so from underwater charging stations. If you are able to make your way to the surface you will discover the fate of mankind, and most importantly - the fate of your family and loved ones.
Atoll is a feature film length game, composed of approximately two hours of revealed narrative, exploration, and resource management driven gameplay.
The game acts as a first person underwater simulator, featuring a vast ocean bottom to explore and survive. Your craft has four key abilities that will assist you in navigating this dark environment, while also avoiding incoming meteor strikes that will drain your craft's energy. Keep your energy above zero as you manage your ship's exploration abilities, or the mission shall fail!

53317,guru-logi-champ,Guru Logi Champ,2001-11-29,,0.0,0,0,3,0,0,"Guru Logi Champ (ぐるロジチャンプ, Guru Roji Chanpu) is a puzzle game by the Japanese developer Compile. The game was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance handheld game system. ""Guru Logi"" is an abbreviation of ""Guruguru Logic"", ""guruguru"" (ぐるぐる) being a Japanese onomatopoeia for a rotating motion.
The game's story mode sees the Champs, small yellow bird-like creatures who attempt to help the inhabitants of their neighbourhood out of various troubles. To do so, they must complete a series of logic puzzles. There are a total of 335 puzzles in the game, and if they are all completed a totally different mini-game is unlocked.
Each stage requires the player to complete an image by placing and removing blocks on the board. The puzzles are set up so that there is no simple solution; often the player is blocked by other immovable areas and so must improvise a solution by constantly constructing and deconstructing their own barriers. The board itself may be rotated so that the player can construct the solution from all four sides. An additional Battle Mode exists in which two players must race to finish puzzles in the fastest time. Battle mode requires a Game Link Cable and only one game pak cartridge.
The game itself is best compared to Picross and Magical Drop. Similar to Picross, a board consisting of a set of blocks creates an image. Similar to Magical Drop, gameplay involves throwing blocks vertically into the play area and sucking them back off again.
There are a number of unofficial remakes of the game:
A port to the MSX2 is currently under development by TNI.
An English 80-level remake available for the PC. This is still a work in progress and has no sound.
There are also completed freeware remakes for the GP2X Wiz and GPH Caanoo by the same programmer (Ian Price) as the PC remake
According to late-2001 GameSpot ads, the game was scheduled to be released in the United States on December 22, 2001, but this was scrapped due to a poor Japanese-to-English translation. In various screenshots of a Beta for the English-language ""Guru Logic Champ"" (the official North American title), many language errors are present.",,,Game Boy Advance,Puzzle,"Singleplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","Compile, D4 Enterprise","Nintendo, Compile",2001

The girls engage in various sports which enhance their natural wiggles and jiggles; jumping rope isn't exactly something the modest will want to engage in when body parts are already hanging loose. The other events include big glove boxing, tree chopping, a pie throwing contest, butt bumping sumo attack, and Kuru Kuru Bout which takes place on two separate pedestals.

Sista, the self-proclaimed ""greatest, sexiest scientist in all of outer space"", has just discovered a way to transform regular puppets into attractive young girls, which she dubs QTS (pronounced ""cuties""). What does she do with this newfound knowledge? Why, she launches a psychedelic space game-show where her girls compete in bizarre tests of skill, of course!

Super Galdelic Hour is a mini-game collection with a retro-psychedelic space theme not unlike Space Channel 5. Choosing from one of four QTS, each representing a different animal, one or two players can compete in 11 different minigames including whack-a-mole, jump rope, and a pie-throwing quick draw contest. There is a single-player story mode where the player can unlock different outfits for the girls, a 2-player versus mode, and a gallery mode where the player can take and save pictures of each of the girls.

The game features 11 Mini Games & 4 unlockables ones:
- Hip Sumo Wrestling
- Whack-A-Mole
- GO! GO! Rolling
- Pool Riders
- Rope Jumpers
- Eccentric Puncher
- Quick Draw-A-Pie

Скоро приедет орава друзей,
В общем всё будет ОКЕЙ!
Будут все весело праздник встречать
И ""Хаба-хаба"" громко кричать!

Но вдруг!
На полу появился зелёный круг!
И стал он к Хаба-дринку приближаться,
И постепенно расширяться.
Хаба кинулась напиток спасать:
Ведь надо же как-то Новый год встречать,
А если нет Хаба-дринка,
То провалится любая вечеринка.
А Хаба-дринк стал исчезать
И очертания свои терять.
Хаба глянула в окно,
А в небе тёмном НЛО,
И луч зёленый светит из него!
Луч этот всё ""съедает""!
Хаба глядь - а тарелка уже улетает.
Хаба кинулась в свой космолёт
И нажала на кнопочку ""ВЗЛЁТ"".
