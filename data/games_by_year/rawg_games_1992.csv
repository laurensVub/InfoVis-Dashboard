###Plot
The game is set during World War II. An American spy of Jewish descend, William Blaskowicz is captured by the SS while searching for intel on Operation: Eisenfaust. Blasko is held captive in the Wolfenstein castle which he later escapes, foils the Nazi plan and kills Adolf Hitler.

###Gameplay
Wolfenstein 3D consists of three episodes, each of which are divided into 10 levels. Every level is some kind of labyrinth built up from rooms and open spaces that are divided by walls and doors. Moreover, on every level, there are secret rooms, that hold specific bonus items. At the end of each level, the players fight with a boss - a unique and buffed up enemy.

The game's art style is heavily inspired by the German bunkers of that era. Wolfenstein 3D is one of the first games to use 2.5-dimensional graphics to immerse the players.

The players are opposed by the SS soldiers, mutants, and guard dogs, which will attack the player only if they get in their line of sight. Several types of enemies can also react to the sounds of gunfire. It is possible to use stealth.

On their way, the players can find ammunition and weaponry, which are either placed on the floor or are taken away from the enemy corpses. The game features 4 weapons: a knife, a pistol, an MP40 SMG and a multi-barrel MG.",https://3drealms.com/catalog/wolfenstein-3d_25/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/,"Jaguar, 3DO, SNES, Classic Macintosh, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, Xbox One, iOS, macOS","Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, Steam Cloud, First-Person, FPS, Classic, Pixel Graphics, Retro, Moddable, 1990's, World War II, vr mod","Bethesda Softworks, id Software, Nerve Software, Interplay Entertainment, Infinity, Logicware, INFINITY Co, STALKER","Electronic Arts, Bethesda Softworks, Activison, Atari, Interplay Productions, id Software, 3D Realms, Empire Interactive, Apogee Software, MacPlay, Apogee, Imagineer, FormGen, Bam Entertainment, Imagineer Co.,Ltd., BAM!

All zones, except the final one, are divided into two or three acts. In each act, your goal Is either to reach the finish of the level or to defeat a boss. The gameplay revolves around Sonic’s ability to run at high speed. The levels involve many objects that help Sonic gain high speed such as slopes, loops, and springs. Sonic can attack enemies and break certain obstacles by using Spin Attack. Like in previous game Spin Attack activates by gaining high speed while rolling on the ground or jumping but Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduces new gameplay mechanic – Spin Dash.

Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past are brought into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley's comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one dare speak of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.

The game was released on several other formats such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.
Lead designer Mike Posehn had no video game experience prior to developing Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed to create a nonlinear game with smoothly animated vehicles. Posehn developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color.
Desert Strike was a commercial success: it was a chart-topping best seller and at the time Electronics Arts' highest selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject matter, with commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the proximity of its release to the recently ended Gulf War.",,,"Commodore / Amiga, SEGA Master System, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, SNES, PC, Game Gear, Genesis",,Singleplayer,Electronic Arts,Electronic Arts,1992

It is the fifth game in the original Mega Man series and was released in Japan on December 4, 1992. It saw a release during the same month in North America and in 1993 in Europe.
Taking place after the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man uncharacteristically leads a group of menacing robots in attacks on the world and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character little choice but to take up arms in a fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.
Mega Man 5 was met with a positive critical reception for its graphics and music, while receiving criticism for its lack of innovation in its plot or gameplay. Like other NES games in the series, Mega Man 5 has been re-released in Japan on the PlayStation, PlayStation Network, and mobile phones; in North America as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection; and in both regions on the Wii Virtual Console.

Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and the first in the central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.
The story follows a nameless protagonist who lives in near-future Tokyo. When a portal to the realm of demons is opened, United States officials order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent.
From the start of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the previous Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was going to happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.",,,"SEGA CD, SNES, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Android, iOS, Wii U, Wii",RPG,Singleplayer,Atlus,Atlus,1992

The game was released as a spin-off to Square's popular Final Fantasy series of video games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a ""simplified role-playing game...designed for the entry-level player"" in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal. The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe.
In the game, the player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways. Many series staples are eliminated, such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story.

Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the ""Model 1"". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience.

The original arcade game has three levels, designated into difficulties. Beginner is ""Big Forest"", intermediate is ""Bay Bridge"" and expert is ""Acropolis"". Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in ""Big Forest"", or the ""Bay Bridge"" itself, or the tight hairpin of ""Acropolis"".

When selecting a car, the player can choose different transmission types. VR introduced the ""V.R. View System"" by allowing the player to choose one of four views to play the game. This feature was then used in most other Sega arcade racing games (and is mentioned as a feature in the attract mode of games such as Daytona USA). It was later ported to home consoles, starting with the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.",,,"SEGA 32X, Genesis, SEGA Saturn, Nintendo Switch",Racing,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Retro, Driving, retro-gaming, formula-1, f1, formula-one, racing-cars, arcade machine",SEGA,"SEGA, Time Warner Interactive",1992

The two deities, who each held extreme viewpoints on the world, ended up corrupting their subjects, and Zofia was eventually swallowed in a war triggered by its military leader, Chancellor Desaix, who attempted a coup d'état. Rigel's ruler Emperor Rudolf used this opportunity to lead Rigel's armies across Valentia in an attempt to conquer both countries. A village boy named Alm sets out on a quest to overthrow Desaix and drive Rudolf out of Zofia. Meanwhile, his childhood friend Celica, in reality the exiled Princess Antheise of Zofia, embarks on a pilgrimage to discover Mila's whereabouts after she vanishes, causing a drought in Zofia. The two meet at Zofia Castle, but part ways when Alm is unwilling to attempt to find a peaceful resolution with Rudolf. Alm invades Rigel and defeats Rudolf, who reveals with his dying breath that Alm is actually his son Albein Alm Rudolf. It is then explained that Rudolf's invasion was intended to strengthen the continent's military forces and create a champion capable of defeating Duma and Mila, who have both fallen into insanity due to their extreme power.

54288,night-trap,Night Trap,1992-10-15,,3.5,10,0,24,0,0,"Night Trap is an interactive movie video game developed by Digital Pictures and originally released by Sega for the Sega CD in 1992. The game is presented primarily through the use of full motion video (FMV). In Night Trap, the player takes the role of a special agent tasked to watch over teenage girls (starring Dana Plato) visiting a house which, unbeknownst to them, is full of danger. The player watches live surveillance footage of the house and triggers traps to capture anyone seen endangering the girls. The player can freely switch their view between different cameras to keep watch over the girls and eavesdrop on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.
The origins of Night Trap can be traced back to a 1986 prototype game developed by Axlon to demonstrate their Control-Vision game console to Hasbro. The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of Night Trap commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. Night Trap was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.
The game received mixed reviews. Critics praised the game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for being one of the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women, prompting toy retailers to pull the game from shelves that December, and Sega to cease its production entirely the following month. The Senate hearing eventually led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video as a game medium. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.",,,"SEGA CD, SEGA 32X, 3DO, Classic Macintosh, PC",,"Singleplayer, controversial",Digital Pictures,"SEGA, font-weight:normal;font-size:inherit;background:transparent;text-align:left",1992

One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as Amiga Power's ""All Time Top 100"". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega Lo Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.
On 12 November 2015, a ""spiritual successor"" to Sensible Soccer, Sociable Soccer, was announced by Jon Hare, and early versions for PC, mobile and Virtual Reality were shown at 9 different public venues across Europe, including Gamescom in Cologne and the London Science Museum in 2016, with development still continuing despite an initially unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.

Since the mausoleum's erection, a dark cloud has overcast the land, giving rise to unspeakable visions of terror and acts of violence from the forces of Nemesis.

The townspeople have once again hired you to perform your feats of wizardry and prowess against what appears to be the work of the villainous Nemesis.

You will now proceed forward into the Towne Cemetery and beyond... seeking the source of the evil, and perhaps uncovering another of Nemesis' diabolical schemes.

You begin your quest in The Towne Cemetery, a place known for its many sad departures. As you take your first tenuous steps inside the dark compound, you reflect on a rumor which you heard in the Towne.

It is rumored that beyond the hedges of the Garden of Tears lies a mausoleum erected to the glory of the evil mage, Nemesis, your arch rival. One can only imagine what nightmarish terrors lurk in his crypt, and in the subterranean worlds that lie below its foundations.

The Sacred Script speaks of an ancient aqueduct system buried beneath the Towne. The revered fables tell us that the aqueduct leads to such diverse haunts as the Orc Mines, the Lair of the Troll, the Demon's Inferno and the fearful Battleground of the Titans.

The Druids speak emphatically about a Coven of Mages which has risen to the call of Nemesis to enslave and torture the inhabitants of the Abyss. These grim Keepers of Esoteric Ways guard the path which leads to the Inner Sanctum of Nemesis and to the certain Ways of Pain.

Curse of Enchantia was Core Design's first attempt in the adventure genre as they set up to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line. The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era, including having many simple action game style sequences and being practically devoid of in-game text and conversations.
Nevertheless, Curse was generally well received upon its release, especially by the Amiga magazines, where the game's graphics and animation received particular praise even as its illogical puzzles and unusual design choices were often criticized.

Start each mission with a review of your flight plan, targets, and orders, then select your armaments and jet into intense, realistic combat from either an aircraft or forward air base.
In 1992 the team behind Harrier Jump Jet created military scenarios around contemporary global flash points. The result is three fascinating, 10-day campaigns in the Falklands, Hong Kong, and Finland. The Hong Kong campaign pits the RAF’s GR5/7 against a variety of little seen Chinese fighters, including the Jian-6 and Shenyang J-8 “Finback.”
The game development team put significant effort into achieving realism, with extra emphasis on modeling the Harrier’s vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. They had working sessions with experienced Harrier combat pilots and engineers at the Royal Airforce Station Wittering (RAF Wittering). RAF Wittering -- known as the “Home of the Harrier” -- is the main operating base and headquarters for the RAF A4 Force.
If you are an air combat simulation fan, Harrier Jump Jet should have a place in your collection. Run a few practice missions to get a handle on this unique aircraft, and then push the difficulty level to Elite and get ready for a serious challenge.

The graphics were handled using advanced tileset algorithms which freed processing power so more detailed graphics could be drawn on the screen. The game uses an expanded sound chip which provided more sound channels than a standard Famicom game. With this special chip, composer Masashi Kageyama was able to create a more advanced score. The soundtrack crosses multiple genres, with Kageyama describing it as a ""compilation of game music"".
Gimmick! received mixed reviews and a lack of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of America did not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.",,,NES,,Singleplayer,SunSoft,Sunsoft,1992

Mothra, Hedorah, and Baragon along with King Ghidorah are added to the line up, and are joined by Rodan. This game, released in place of an earlier announced game meant to star Rodan, was received poorly by audiences, due in part to a lack of a genuine plot, and due to the game having an extremely arbitrary style of combat, which was difficult for many players to understand. It was the third Godzilla game for a Nintendo system to be released in North America, after Godzilla: Monster of Monsters for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Godzilla for Nintendo Game Boy.

The Genesis title is one of three video games created to tie into the release of Predator 2. Also produced were a Commodore game and a Master System game. Despite the fact all three were released under the title Predator 2, gameplay actually varies quite substantially across the three titles.

The game is an isometric shooter where players shoot down enemies while rescuing hostages. At the same time, the player must avoid the Predator's attack as well as preventing the Predator from killing the hostages themselves. If enough hostages are killed the game will be over. There are various pickups. These range from health packs, various types of weaponry, or drugs that can increase the player's score.

You managed to get stuck in an anti-aircraft bunker in a strategic area, without any troop reinforcements. You know that the enemy is going to be coming in droves, so you're glad that you have a huge supply of ammo to defend yourself.

###THE GAME:

Your bunker is at the bottom of the screen. You control the position of the gun with either the keyboard (using the left & right arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to shoot) or the mouse.

The enemy aircraft will be coming across the top of the screen, dropping paratroopers as they go. You need to prevent the paratroopers from landing, because if three of them land, they'll be able to invade your bunker and overpower you! (Fortunately for you, they bicker amongst themselves so much that if they land right next to each other, one of them will kill the other.)

You can shoot the planes. You can shoot the paratroopers. You can shoot the paratroopers' chutes off, and watch them plummet helplessly to the ground (killing any paratroopers that happen to be underneath). Basically, if it moves, shoot it...

Be extremely careful with the smart bombs - they're deadly!

###INTERMISSIONS:

After you've beaten back enough of the enemy troops, there'll be a chance for your compatriots to supply a few things to satisfy basic human needs. Enjoy the reprieve while you can!

K-9 also makes appearances later in the game as does Davros, creator of the Daleks in the TV series, as the final end of level boss. The game is set in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Skaro.
The game was released on all major formats of the time except for the Amstrad CPC, which was announced but never released. It was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development. Graphics were by John Gyarmati and Wayne Dalton. Nick Kimberley programmed the PC, Spectrum and (unreleased) Amstrad versions. The Amiga and Atari ST versions were programmed by Richard Turner. Jason Heggie was in charge of the Commodore 64 version. Music was by Paul Tankard. On the PC and Amiga versions, there was a secret room behind some blocks. The room gave some of the programming credits for each game, in particular the graphics and music. The credits were hidden in this way due to the BBC not wanting individual credits for the game development team to be included in the game. Perhaps surprisingly, the PC version, which had the most sophisticated graphics, and the ZX Spectrum version, the most basic version, were both coded by the same person. This was due to the similarities between Z80 and 8086 assembly language.
Alternative Software released the ZX Spectrum version only due to popular demand, since by 1992 the Spectrum was no longer a commercially viable platform. Dalek Attack was released for the Spectrum in 1993, and was the last licensed Spectrum game. It differed from all the others in its first level; in all the other releases the first level involved the Doctor on a hoverboard going along the sewer. The Spectrum version had the Doctor on foot running around collecting hostages and avoiding globes. The Spectrum version also lost out on other features such as different enemies; only the Robomen, Ogrons and standard Daleks featured. The end-level guardians were also different. Before its release Spectrum owners who wrote to Alternative software pressing for a release received a letter back stating that the game was in production, and were sent a sticker depicting the game's box front emblazoned with the legend ""I've Been Exterminated!""
Other versions of the game featured special Daleks such as hovering Daleks from the TV Century 21 comics strips of the 1960s. 1960s ""movie"" Daleks also made an appearance, as did the special weapons Dalek from Remembrance of the Daleks. Another special Dalek also featured, based on a sketch in an article from the Doctor Who Magazine 10th anniversary special showing how a Dalek might look when the television series came back.
The game was later re-released, first in a three pack compilation set called the Sci-Fi Collection with two other titles (Galactic Warrior Rats, Suburban Commando) for the PC. The front cover was in a ""Y"" shape with Dalek Attack in the bottom right and the instruction booklet was photocopied. This was followed in 1994/95 by another re-release, which was the same as the original except for a purple and black border added to the front and back covers.",,,"Commodore / Amiga, Atari ST, PC",,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Alternative Software,Alternative Software,1992

The game is loosely based on the 1991 made-for-television American film Adventures in Dinosaur City by Smart Egg Pictures, and borrows many of the film's characters, settings, and basic plot while providing its own unique art direction and style. Initially released in July 1992 for Japanese audiences, the game was later made available in North America the following September. The game centers on two friends, Timmy and Jamie, young children who are accidentally transported to a world resembling prehistoric Earth populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs.

It was developed by UK-based company Zippo Games for Rare; it was published by Acclaim and released in North America in March 1992 and in Europe on January 21, 1993. It is the third and final installment in the Wizards & Warriors series and is the sequel to the 1989 title Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II. The game picks up immediately from the events at the end of Ironsword where the knight warrior Kuros had just defeated the evil wizard Malkil from the peak of IceFire Mountain. Unaware that Malkil's spirit is still intact, Kuros gets struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit, causing him to lose his armor, memory, and honor. Malkil then flees to the city of Piedup and seizes the throne from Good King James. Meanwhile, Kuros, after wandering for months in the wilderness without weapons, armor, or food, arrives at the city of Piedup, where he must build strength and utilize various disguises and abilities in order to take on Malkil. The game is nonlinear and requires players to explore various areas to pick up items and gain abilities to unlock different parts of the city in order to progress.
Wizards & Warriors III was developed by Zippo Games' founders Ste and John Pickford, who also had a few additional programmers and artists to assist them. The Pickford brothers designed the game as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game's (Rare's former incarnation) 1983 ZX Spectrum title Atic Atac; they also drew inspiration for gameplay and art from other NES titles such as Metroid, Faxanadu, and Super Mario Bros. 3. The game had moderate sales, though not as good as its predecessor Ironsword. It was praised for its bold graphics, expansive gameplay, and challenge. However, it was mostly criticized for its controls, lack of fighting, and the lack of continues or passwords. While the game received mixed reviews, Ste Pickford said that this game was his personal favorite. Zippo Games, which was acquired by Rare and was known as Rare Manchester during development, shut down shortly before this game's completion, and while the game hinted at another sequel, it has never occurred.",,,NES,"Action, Adventure, Platformer",Singleplayer,Rare,Acclaim,1992

There were no attempts to release a cricket video game to the North American, Japanese, or European markets. The reason is that baseball games dominated the North American and Japanese markets while soccer dominated the European market during that era. Two buttons are used to control the action; one for hitting the cricket ball while the other allows the player to slog around.
One of the shortcomings in the game is the simple AI; the average player can bowl the computer out for totals not exceeding 20.

One of these people was a coal miner named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov: Atomic Runner from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.

While the level design and enemy placement is identical in the later released Genesis (and subsequently Wii) version, the graphics have been significantly changed: now each level is based on a ancient human civilization and the enemies (including bosses) are replaced. Also all references to atomic explosions have been removed from the background story. Now Chernov is the son of a scientist. The evil Deathtarians, who claim to be the original population of the Earth and want to control this planet, murdered his father and abducted his sister. Chelnov takes a special suit made by his father, which give him super-human powers and make him an ""Atomic Runner"".

Andor is our planet, a small part of which makes up the Shattered Realms. Around us is a vast desert wasteland, the legacy of an ancient Cataclysm that destroyed the once highly technological society that thrived here.

In the Realms, life has taken hold again. You live in the City of Fayd, an old metropolis predating the Cataclysm. There are many ancient places here including catacombs beneath the city itself, and vast subterranean areas far beneath the surface!

To the north lies a great range of mountains known as the Teeth of Shartan, it too, is honeycombed with caves. Rolling hills and grassy plains, as well as the great Inner Sea, lay to the east and south. The great forest of Grymwood stands to the west. Only the dangerous and forbidding Great Waste lies beyond these borders.

A variety of creatures populate the Shattered Realms. The most common is the elder race: humans. Their forefathers lived alone in the pre-Cataclysmic world. Now, humans share the world with the aelfen of the forests, the highlanders of the mountain, the murg of the caves, and the drakin of the skies. In addition, you will meet wolflings, a race of shape changers that can assume human or wolf form; ephemerals, a race of noncorporeal entities and their relatives the mechanoids, a race of robots imbued with a spirit. You may even encounter those with the arcane knowledge of becoming a vampire. Besides these, the world is rich in flora and fauna; thousands of creatures, both good and evil, beautiful and monstrous, inhabit the land.

The Realms are rich in magic, the existence of which became known at the time of the Change. Sorcerers everywhere ply their mystic talents in four basic schools: druidic, enchantment, necromancy and conjuration. Others delve into history to find the clues that would allow them to understand the most ancient of all magic - technology.

Some people have thought that the final version is the sequel but Kosola says that there has never been Turboraketti II.
Turboraketti is played by two people fighting each other with spaceships. The game is similar to an earlier game called Gravity Force. The ships are viewed from a side perspective and gravity pulls ships down. The screen is split in two halves in vertical direction. Both players have one half of the screen. Hitting a landscape or another ship destroys the vessel. Movement of ships is affected by their thrust, gravity and drag in air and liquid.
The players can choose from various weapons that are advantageous in different situations. Rapid fire weapons are good for causing at least some damage for the opponent and non-rapid fire weapons are good for hitting the opponent hard from proximity. The players can load weapons and fuel on their base platforms. The base platform can also repair a ship. The player needs to make a trade-off between good acceleration (small mass) and the amount of ordnance and fuel loaded.

The game is set around the time of World War I, where the player maneuvers biplanes, automobiles, animals, and various other unidentifiable objects to battle an army of mech-wielding scientists.

The player uses the 8-way joystick to control the biplane's movements, and the 2 buttons to shoot or hook enemies. The biggest characteristic of the player's biplane is the hook attached to its rear section. The hook is also controlled by the joystick, and enemies or objects that come in contact with the hook are dragged along by the plane. Dragged objects cause damage to anything they collide with, and the player can release the objects on the hook by pressing the hook button again. Dragged objects are destroyed when the player releases them from the hook, or if they collide enough times to break apart.

The ship's power gauge increases when the player taps the shot button rapidly, and filling up the gauge causes the plane to shoot a bolt of lightning that covers a large area of the screen. However, the plane overheats if the player taps the shot button too many times, so this attack must be used sparingly.

The game's graphics are highly detailed, and many of the backgrounds are likened to European towns and cities or World's fair-like scenes. Many of the game's background objects can also be destroyed or dragged around with the hook.",,,,Shooter,,Data East,Data East,1992

Although it may appear to be a program for young kids, don't let the circus themes fool you. The themes actually serve as clever hooks for problems and puzzles that cover many more subjects than math, and will appeal to math buffs of all ages. The Trapeze activity, for example, teaches you about pendulums, while Captain Blunthead in Cannon Shoot (my favorite game in this one) teaches about propulsion, angles, and more.

There are twelve puzzles/activities in all, each with five levels of difficulty that range from very simple (for pre-schoolers) to very challenging (even for teachers and parents). The problems range widely in type, involving spatial reasoning, perceiving patterns in size, order or time, and manipulating a number of variables in order to help the circus performers do their tricks.

With excellent game design, a wide variety of fun and original games, multiple difficulty levels, and superb educational value, M*A*T*H*S Circus is a must-have for parents looking for a solid math title, as well as gamers who don't mind a little mental exercise once in a while. Revised in early 1997, M*A*T*H*S Circus is now offered in a Windows 3.1/95 version with enhanced graphics and sounds, as well as support for players with disability.

966901,maka-maka,Maka Maka,1992-04-24,,0.0,0,0,3,0,0,"""Maka Maka is an obscure (at least in America) RPG for the Super Famicom made by Office Koukan and published by Sigma Enterprises in 1992. It takes place on an Earth where Ultraman-style aliens, giant cannibalistic alien princesses, and evil, faceless ant-men are completely normal, and the main character is the reincarnated form of an alien prince who defeated an evil demon king millennia ago. Now, completely resurrected and full of power again, said demon king wants revenge, organizing the Maka Maka Society to conquer Earth. It's a standard JRPG full of quirky Japanese humor that makes you wonder if the designers were on anything.

Office Koukan took so much time working on the game that it only got up to prototype phase by the time the release date was beginning to draw near. Sigma, having no choice but to cancel the game if they didn't release it, did the only thing they could possibly do to avoid losing money: They copied, shipped, and sold the prototype of the game in bulk. With the game in such a terrible, glitchy state, it quickly became a part of many Japanese gamers' Bottom 100 games, and Sigma went out of business.""",,,SNES,RPG,,,,1992
