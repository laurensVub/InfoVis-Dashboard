GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.

The main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.

The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time.

###The main thing about the series of games Stronghold

The game Stronghold - a simulator of three activities:
the construction of a medieval castle,
military actions - assault of the castle or its defense,
creation and management of the village.

###The atmosphere and situation of the first game

Briefly, this is the stylization of the Middle Ages. Game events begin in 1066, but there are often no time limits, so theoretically, missions can last dozens and even hundreds of game years.

###The path of war and the path of peace

The game allows you to build - a settlement or a castle, carry out individual economic missions or just build freely, and destroy - invade the country, take the castle under siege or, on the contrary, crush the attackers. You can create your own maps and play in multiplay mode.

###Gameplay

You are the ruler of the castle, you are responsible for both the economy and the war. Do not forget about the popularity - it's a separate indicator in the game.

You can build six types of buildings:
the castle and everything inside it - walls, towers, gates, barracks, ditches, etc.,
sawmills, quarries, mines and other structures for extraction of resources - wood, stone, iron and oil.
Farms that bring meat, milk, wheat, apples, hops, skins of cows,
city ​​buildings - houses, churches, wells,
Weapon workshops, where they produce weapons and armor,
Barns and shops for cheese, bread, ale

Buildings are built instantly, it is only necessary to make such a decision. Just as quickly your soldiers are trained. But all this requires money obtained from the collection of taxes and trade.

To succeed in the economy it is not enough just to make calculations. We have to cope with unpredictable disasters like the invasion of rabbits or fire.

The war is fought by soldiers of close combat and distant combat: archers, crossbowmen, pikemen, swordsmen, spearmen, knights and even monks with clubs.

Troops can shoot from towers, move around walls, destroy walls, use siege machines, including towers, while besieged have boiling resin tanks, pits with stakes and moats with water. You can dig trenches and even organize an epidemic in the enemy camp. For complex actions, except soldiers, you need to involve sappers and engineers.

###Addition Stronghold Crusader HD

The first crusade of 1094-1099,
Saladin's campaigns of 1187,
the expedition of Richard the Lionheart, Friedrich Barbarossa and the French Philip II in order to liberate Jerusalem

###Plot
The game's core story revolves around a human colony on the distant planet of Helios. Extra-terrestrial entities invade the planet, causing the planet-wide mobilization of its armed forces. The player controls a soldier, who is sent to repel the alien attack in his trusty mech suit.

###Gameplay
The game combines both a shooter and an aerial combat simulator.

The mech that is controlled by the player is developed as part of a Gunmetal project. These mechs stand twelve meters tall in their default configuration and are equipped with numerous weapons and force fields, that absorb an enormous amount of damage.

Upon transformation, the mech becomes a modern reactive hypersound plane, similar to the American F-22 Raptor series of combat planes, that is equipped with a set of advanced sci-fi weaponry, including napalm, impulse cannons, harpoons, and ballistic rockets, yet it loses the ability of using its force field, thus rendering the plane mode much less sustainable to damage. 

The players can choose the set or armament that is installed on their mech, with 12 weapons present in the game. Each weapon has its own up's and down's hence why it is necessary to pick them carefully.",http://kiss-ltd.co.uk/,,"PC, Xbox",Action,"Singleplayer, Steam Cloud, steam-trading-cards, Partial Controller Support, Third-Person Shooter, Robots, Mechs",Rage Software,"Kiss, Funbox Media",2002

The tenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released in Japan in December 2002, in North America in March 2003, and in Europe in May 2003.
The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea, a departure for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.
The Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but with a distinctive cartoon-like art style created through cel shading. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but the art style proved divisive among players, which contributed to comparatively weak sales. As a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next Zelda installment, the more realistically-styled Twilight Princess. However, The Wind Waker's reputation improved over time, and it is now widely considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The Wind Waker originated the ""Toon Link"" variant of the main character, and received two direct sequels for the Nintendo DS, Phantom Hourglass (2007) and Spirit Tracks (2009). A high-definition remaster, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, was released for the Wii U in 2013, to critical acclaim.",,,GameCube,Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, cooperative, exclusive, true exclusive",Nintendo,Nintendo,2002

Duke Nukem takes his Mighty Boot to the Big Apple. Using G.L.O.P.P.

In Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project, Duke must deploy W.I.N. (Weapons, Insults and Name-Calling) to rid the city of goo-based bad guys, and return peace and tranquility to The City That Never Sleeps.
Originally released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem in 2002, Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project blends together the best elements of Duke Nukem 3D and the best 2D sidescrolling of the first two games in the series, Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II.
From babes, bombs and Battlelords, to goggles, guns and Gargoyles, revisit Duke's dynasty with these re-released classics. Return to a time when the King Of Action didn't need regenerative health or auto-aim - a time when action games were actually about action, an era when heroes had the strength to carry as many guns as they wanted and use as many cheats as they needed.
Celebrate Duke Nukem's 20th anniversary in sunshade-wearing, quick-quipping style with a title that - alongside the re-release of Duke's first two adventures - recognizes a series that's had a tremendous impact on an entire industry, and represents the best of Duke in a way that no other game could.

It was released in North America on November 17, 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics. Because exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. On the same day as its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994).
Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters in 2000.
The game garnered critical praise and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic.

###Gameplay
The Lost Souls is a strategy in the war setting. The player can experience the action in 3D, so he may continuously rotate the camera to get the better angle to the actions. There is three military campaign, which can be otherwise presented as a story arcs. The only working tactics through all of the operations are a war of attrition because the other military tricks do not work there.
The units have experience gauges, once filled up they grant the player with an extra level increasing all his stats and characteristics.
The games of the series are often criticized for the minor adjustments from game to game, so the gameplay part changes a little within the IP. 

###Story
The first arc called ED tells a story of Сzar Vladimir II thrown forward in time and forced to give commands to attack the Lunar Corporation to get some resources.
LC campaign's narrative is all about the encountering the enemy's base in Ukraine — the newcomer from the ED mission picks the quest up.

It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002 in Japan, and has since been released on multiple platforms. The Nintendo DS version, initially released in 2006 in Japan, was released in English in the West in 2007. The game is the second entry in the Ace Attorney series, following Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.
The story follows Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney who defends his clients in four episodes. Among other characters are his partner Maya Fey, her cousin Pearl, and the rival prosecutor Franziska von Karma. The game is divided into two types of sections: courtroom sessions, where the player cross-examines witnesses and tries to uncover contradictions in their testimonies; and investigations, where the player gathers evidence and talks to witnesses.
The game was directed and written by Shu Takumi, as the second entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi wanted to use the character more carefully and sparingly. They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi wanted to keep the game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep it simple enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.",,,"PC, Game Boy Advance, Android, Wii, Nintendo DS, iOS",Adventure,"Story, Visual Novel, character, Single player only, defense, japan",Capcom Production Studio 4,Capcom,2002

Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer.

Blood Omen 2, the second instalment in the Legacy of Kain Series, is a 3rd person 3D action/combat game in which you assume the role of the vampire Kain. A compelling story takes you through huge, lushly detailed 3D environments and challenges your skills in combat, puzzle solving, stealth and exploration.

As you develop a stronger, more skilled vampire, you’ll be rewarded with dozens of dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the continuing epic of Nosgoth, and Kain’s attempts to ultimately rule over it.
Move through crowds unseen cloaked in stealth, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and use mind-control on hapless fools to help you overcome vampire-proof inventions.

56191,resident-evil-zero,Resident Evil Zero,2002-11-12,83.0,3.8,99,0,293,0,0,"Resident Evil Zero, known in Japan as Biohazard Zero, is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the fifth major installment in the Resident Evil series and was originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. It is a prequel to Resident Evil (2002), covering the ordeals experienced in the Arklay Mountains by the special police force, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. The story follows officer Rebecca Chambers and convicted criminal Billy Coen as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The gameplay is similar to early Resident Evil games, but includes a unique ""partner zapping"" system. The player controls both Rebecca and Billy, switching control between them to solve puzzles and use their unique abilities.
Development for Resident Evil Zero began on the Nintendo 64 in 1998. The partner system was created to take advantage of the short load times possible with the capabilities of the N64 Game Pak. The cartridge format also provided limitations, as the storage capacity was significantly less than that of a CD-ROM. The team had to approach the design differently from previous series entries to conserve storage space. Resident Evil Zero was designed to be more difficult than previous Resident Evil games. Inspired by Sweet Home (1989), the team removed the item storage boxes present in earlier games and introduced a new item-dropping feature. Development slowed when the team encountered memory storage problems, and so production was moved to the newly announced GameCube. The game had to be rebuilt, with only the concept and story carried over.
Resident Evil Zero received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics and audio for building a haunting atmosphere. Opinions on the new partner and item systems were mixed. Some found the changes were an improvement and added new layers of strategy; others believed the changes were cumbersome or non-innovative. The controls were panned as outdated and Capcom was criticized for not evolving the series' tank controls. The game was ported to the Wii in 2008, and a high-definition remaster was released in January 2016. These re-releases received mixed reviews due to lack of improvements made to the original. Resident Evil Zero is commercially successful, having sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.",,,"Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, GameCube, Wii",Action,Singleplayer,Capcom,Capcom,2002

It was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Griptonite Games, to the GameCube by Hypnos Entertainment, and to mobile by JAMDAT. A version for Microsoft Windows developed by Ritual Entertainment was cancelled during development. The game was published on all platforms by Electronic Arts. Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile. In November 2003, EA released a sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.
The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Two Towers, the second volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. EA chose not to publish a game based on Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film, instead incorporating some of the plot and footage into their The Two Towers game, which was released a few weeks after Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, a licensed adaptation of Tolkien's novel The Fellowship of the Ring.
The Two Towers received a generally positive response, with critics praising the re-creation of sets and scenes from the films, and the epic scope of some of the battles. Some, however, criticized the game for being too short and the combat overly repetitive. The game was a financial success, selling almost four million units, and outselling Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, which sold just over one million.",https://www.ea.com/games/lord-of-the-rings/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers,,"PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Xbox, GameCube",Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, cooperative",Stormfront Studios,Electronic Arts,2002

It was the first Castlevania game to be called ""Castlevania"" in Japan instead of ""Akumajō Dracula"".
Harmony of Dissonance occurs in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series; the premise of the series centers on the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Set fifty years after Simon Belmont vanquished Dracula's curse, Harmony of Dissonance focuses on his grandson Juste Belmont and his quest to rescue a kidnapped childhood friend.
Koji Igarashi produced Harmony of Dissonance with the intent of ""creat[ing] a game that was similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"", the critically acclaimed PlayStation game that he had worked on. Harmony of Dissonance sold 126,000 units in the United States and did not become a ""huge hit in Japan"".

It is the sixth entry in the Fire Emblem series, the first title produced for the system, and the first title to appear on a handheld console. It was released in Japan in March 2002.
The Binding Blade is set on the fictional continent of Elibe, which is dominated by humans in the wake of an ancient war between humanity and dragons. The story follows Roy from the small country of Pherae as he leads a growing army against the forces of King Zephiel of the kingdom of Bern, who is gradually taking over Elibe. As with other Fire Emblem games, battles take place on a grid-based map, with player units assigned character classes taking part in single combat with enemies and being subject to permanent death if defeated.
The Binding Blade began development as a Nintendo 64 title called Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, but internal changes caused the project to change its platform to the GBA, scrapping nearly all of its original content in the process. One of Intelligent Systems' main goals was to make the game more forgiving to newcomers than the notoriously difficult Fire Emblem: Thracia 776. Upon release, it was praised by critics and sold over 345,000 units. Despite never releasing overseas, Roy's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee contributed to the localization of its 2004 prequel, released overseas as Fire Emblem.",,,Game Boy Advance,"RPG, Strategy",Singleplayer,"Nintendo, Intelligent Systems",Nintendo,2002

The game was released on September 23, 2002, and was the final Nintendo game that Rare developed, before it was acquired by Microsoft to be a part of its Xbox division the day after the game's release in North America. The game's story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and save it from destruction.
The game received mostly positive reviews, notably on its detailed graphics, new character designs on characters including Fox, and its dynamic environments.

Skirmish and multiplayer modes allow the choice of playing as all three factions.
Successfully completed missions result in ship and fleet enhancements, more experienced crews, and upgraded weapons. Royal Navy Fleet weapons are only slightly inferior to the reworked weapons of the Procyon Fleet but are sturdier and less vulnerable. Ships for the Royal Navy range from torpedo boats and war sloops to escorts, frigates, and the impressive StarHammer, while pirates man sloops, gunboats, schooners, assault cutters, and more, including several unique designs like the carrack and barque. The Procyon Fleet is built for speed and maneuverability, geared for fast hit-and-run attacks, and as the game progresses, news of a mysterious Ironclad Fleet surfaces as well.
Ship designs in Battle at Procyon are fashioned after the seafaring ships from the golden age of sail, with solar winds filling the sails and rigging. Arsenals reflect futuristic models of light, medium, and heavy weapons such as laserball and plasma cannons, beam weapons, Gatling guns, harpoons, fire and net launchers, gravity waves, torpedoes, mortars, and more.

It is the first installment in the Mega Man Zero series, the fifth series in Capcom's Mega Man video game franchise. It was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, and in North America and Europe later that year.
Mega Man Zero is set 100 years following the Mega Man X saga of games. The plot follows the Reploid protagonist Zero, who is awakened from a century of sleep to aid a human scientist named Ciel and her resistance force in a fight against the utopia of Neo Arcadia, which is attempting to unjustly wipe out all androids it views as threats. Like its predecessors in the original Mega Man series and Mega Man X series, Mega Man Zero is an action-platformer. However, the game forgoes the franchise's traditional format of letting the player select stages and acquire each boss's weapon. It instead features a smaller number of upgradable weapons and mission-based progression within a large, interconnected world. The player may also acquire special power-ups called ""Cyber Elves"" which supplement the player's abilities or add various effects to a mission's stage.
Mega Man Zero was produced as a commission product by Inti Creates for Capcom. The developer was responsible for all aspects of the game except the inclusion of the protagonist Zero, which was requested by series producer Keiji Inafune. Mega Man Zero has enjoyed a mostly positive press reception. Critics lauded the game's storyline, graphics, and tweaks on the franchise's classic action formula, though many were put off by aspects of its extreme difficulty level. Mega Man Zero garnered strong sales upon its debut and went on to produce three direct sequels on the GBA, as well as two titles in a sequel series on the Nintendo DS.

The plot and characters have very little relation with the previous Clock Tower games. The story follows 14-year-old Alyssa Hamilton who is part of a family lineage of female warriors who travel through time to defeat evil spirits. Alyssa travels from her time in 2003 London to the 1940s and 1960s in order to defeat these ""Entities"" and bring peace to troubled souls. 

Gameplay:
Played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. It's the first game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, as opposed to the point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies (""Subordinates""). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.

Story:
The story of Clock Tower 3 is set in London in 2003. Alyssa Hamilton is a 14-year-old girl who has been living at a boarding school for three years. Her mother, Nancy, sent her there after her grandfather, Dick, disappeared. The game begins with Alyssa receiving a letter from her mother telling her to go into hiding until after her fifteenth birthday. Alarmed, Alyssa decides to go against her mother's wishes and return home. However, when she arrives at the boarding house in which they live, her mother is absent, and the only person there is a man called ""The Dark Gentleman"". Determined to find her mother, Alyssa explores her mother's room. Suddenly, Frédéric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu begins to play with no apparent source, and Alyssa is transported back in time to the streets of London during World War II.",,,PlayStation 2,Adventure,"exclusive, true exclusive",Capcom,Capcom,2002

300684,megaman-zero,MegaMan Zero,2002-09-10,,4.56,9,0,42,0,0,"Mega Man Zero, known in Japan as Rockman Zero (ロックマン ゼロ), is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the first installment in the Mega Man Zero series, the fifth series in Capcom's Mega Man video game franchise. It was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, and in North America and Europe later that year.

Mega Man Zero is set 100 years following the Mega Man X saga of games. The plot follows the Reploid protagonist Zero, who is awakened from a century of sleep to aid a human scientist named Ciel and her resistance force in a fight against the utopia of Neo Arcadia, which is attempting to unjustly wipe out all androids it views as threats. Like its predecessors in the original Mega Man series and Mega Man X series, Mega Man Zero is an action-platformer. However, the game forgoes the franchise's traditional format of letting the player select stages and acquire each boss's weapon. It instead features a smaller number of upgradable weapons and mission-based progression within a large, interconnected world. The player may also acquire special power-ups called ""Cyber Elves"" which supplement the player's abilities or add various effects to a mission's stage.

Mega Man Zero was produced as a commission product by Inti Creates for Capcom. The developer was responsible for all aspects of the game except the inclusion of the protagonist Zero, which was requested by series producer Keiji Inafune. Mega Man Zero has enjoyed a mostly positive press reception. Critics lauded the game's storyline, graphics, and tweaks on the franchise's classic action formula, though many were put off by aspects of its extreme difficulty level. Mega Man Zero garnered strong sales upon its debut and went on to produce three direct sequels on the GBA, as well as two titles in a sequel series on the Nintendo DS. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on October 22, 2014.[4]",,,"Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance","Action, RPG, Platformer","console, boss, japan",Inti Creates,Capcom,2002

One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.

They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.

Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.

Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode.

The world is populated by people who have never seen the sky and the sun in their lives. The world is dark and hostile, and knows no mercy. Technology is well developed in this world, but the society is ruled by a cruel law, dividing all the citizens into classes, depending on the their D-ratio - a form of identifying people and assigning to them a social status at the same time. This is the reality of mankind somewhere in a fantasy universe, where the hero Ryu is thrown into.

Ryu is a simple guard, a ranger with a low D-ratio - his job is to help to protect the citizens from genics - artificial monsters who have gone wild. During one of such routine patrols, Ryu runs into a mysterious silent girl named Nina, and saves her from a monster. Willing to protect her, Ryu discovers in himself a devastating power. He is now determined to do something for the people of Deep Earth, and perhaps even guide them to the surface of the planet.

Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.

The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over.

Like the much earlier Super Robot Wars Gaiden, the game features no licensed mecha or characters at all - instead, it uses only Banpresto's own creations, in an original story.

Those games and tools have been refactored into a few systems to support exploring new game mechanics and procedural generation.
This project is open-source! Check out the code on github, and feel free to fork it or ping me if you want to learn more about how things are implemented!
Purchasing the game is a great way to help support this project's growth - I have plans for more addons, docs, and breaking reusable abstractions out of this code base. Thank you for your support!
Dino features a set of short games using platformer and top-down mechanics that take place across dungeon crawler and metroidvania-style maps.
Dino is an ongoing work in progress! It's a sandbox to create toys and experiments in, and a way to learn/share game dev architecture patterns.
At launch, Dino features only a few games:
- Classic Mode
One side-scroller level at a time, featuring a progression of Dino Battles
- Tower
A platformer about climbing vertically through rooms.
- The Woods
A runner about catching leaves and getting lost!
More games are nearly complete, but still works-in-progress at launch. These will be added in the coming weeks and months!
- Vania
Bringing Dino's side-scrolling entities all together into a small metroidvania.
- Shirt
Similar to Vania, but focused on Dino's Top-Down entities. The name is Tunic-inspired!

The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to mediocre reviews and poor sales.",,,"Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2","Sports, Racing","Singleplayer, Multiplayer","Underground Development, Z-Axis","Acclaim Entertainment, AKA Acclaim",2002

Other features include a life system, which re-spawns you in place when you die, and auto-aiming. The player can access multiplayer via system link and split-screen.

The player can also align their favorite weapons to the X and Y button by selecting a weapon and holding X or Y, then press X or Y again to select that weapon.

Battles carry over the skill-based leveling systems and nonlinear structure of earlier SaGa titles, with an exploration structure similar to a board game.

Duel Monsters 5 Expert 1 is a video game for the Game Boy Advance, and the first game to follow the real OCG/TCG rules. The game is very similar to its English version (Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul) in the story, but different in the graphics and the Booster Packs (The Eternal Duelist Soul uses the same graphic as Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel). Gameplay is similar to standard dueling rules, except that the Side Deck can have less than 15 cards, and is more for convenience of getting to cards for your Deck than switching between duels, as CPU duels are single duels rather than matches (though you will have a match duel against a character every two weeks on a Saturday).

You will play as a Ukrainian military drone operator who fights enemy forces, salvages valuable equipment, and restores crucial communication lines disrupted by the conflict.
But that's not all. What sets Death From Above apart is that it's not just a game but also a means to make an impact!
30% of the net proceeds will be equally split between two Ukrainian organizations supporting non-offensive aid to the Ukrainian Armed forces: Come Back Alive and Army of Drones. This way, you can feel confident that your purchase contributes to a worthy cause. Once we’ve broken even on the game, we will increase this contribution, sending 70% of our net revenues to these good causes. The remaining 30% will be invested in further developing the game.Key Features:Interplay between operator and Drone
After you deplete your drone's ammo, you must return to your operator's position to rearm. Risk trekking deeper into enemy territory for a quick and easy top-up, or stay at a distance to assure your survival!
Clear the Ukrainian steppe of Russian invaders!
Seek out, bomb, and destroy HQ camps, vehicles, and military depots; stay focused, and switch between top-down and third-person perspectives to maximize your impact!
Take over control towers to restore communication lines!
Patrol the area, neutralize defenses, then bring in the operator for a successful mission!
Recover stolen washing mac-*ahem*...Precious hardware!
The invaders are always on the lookout for any hardware they can grab. Keep on the lookout for any stragglers and recover this precious resource!
Death From Above is our first game under the Lesser Evil brand and our first statement. It’s a conscious decision to engage with a difficult issue that directly affects millions of people's lives in Ukraine and beyond, a decision that some might see as controversial.
While we embrace controversy and difficult conversations, we don’t believe in controversy for its own sake or the sake of sales. We engage in these topics because we are convinced they are important and that the power of video games can be a tool for political and social activism. Death From Above is no exception to that.
Additionally, we’re proud to help spread this message of support for Ukraine’s defense
Are you ready to help Ukraine and make Death from Above the best game it can be?
If you want to help us or even become a part of the project, now is the best time to reach out! Join the virtual fight for Ukraine’s freedom, and express your support for the cause.

Everything from the visuals to the audio to the gameplay was designed and tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible.
SYSTEM initializing...
Multiple virus infections detected...
Launching DEVASTATOR program...
You are the Devastator!  Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles.  In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes.  In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors.  And in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves.  Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System!
In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety.  From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy.

Turbo-firing at the start (move fast without firing to build), and a charged blast at the end.
Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, four customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors.  With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future.
Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy).  Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005.  With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter.

Set directly following the events of Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?, main protagonist Ichiro Ogami returns to Tokyo and reunites with the Imperial Assault Force, a troop of magically-imbued women who defend Tokyo from supernatural threats while also working as a theater company. The two main plot threads focus on Ogami acting as the producer for the group's adaptation of Les Misérables, alongside the escape of a hostile ghost that requires the combined efforts of the Imperial Assault Force and Sakura Wars 3's Paris Assault Force to defeat.
Sakura Wars 4 was intended to take place in New York, continuing Ogami's overseas adventures. When the Dreamcast was discontinued by Sega, the development team instead decided to create a celebratory game to conclude Ogami's narrative. The game took just ten months to make, ending up much shorter than previous Sakura Wars games. While reusing gameplay assets from Sakura Wars 3, the graphics were improved using new software tools. The game has been praised by critics, and is one of Japan's best-selling Dreamcast titles. The game's initial concepts would be used in the next entry, Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love.",,,"PC, Dreamcast",Strategy,Singleplayer,"Overworks, RED Company",SEGA,2002

It was created by Broccoli in July 2000, when it launched a multi-platformed project called Project G.A. The anime and Galaxy Angel Party manga comprise a comedy story in an alternate universe, while the games and the regular manga have a serious romance and action plot.
A sequel to the game trilogy was released in June 2006, entitled Galaxy Angel II: Zettai Ryōiki no Tobira, and stars an entirely new cast, the ""Rune Angel Troupe"", and a new feature that combines the new Brave Heart frame with any of the Angels. Each of the Rune Angels has a connection to one of the Galaxy Angels, such as Apricot Sakuraba, the younger sister of Milfeulle Sakuraba. Just like the original Galaxy Angel, the Galaxy Angel II series is a trilogy of games and has a manga adaptation and comedic anime spinoff. The second Galaxy Angel II game was released in October 2007 entitled Galaxy Angel II: Mugen Kairō no Kagi.
The success of the video game and anime series influenced the creation of a manga series based on the video game universe. In Japan, the series became so popular that a musical based on the series was made.

It is the second entry in the Infinity series; it is preceded by Never 7: The End of Infinity, and followed by Remember 11: The Age of Infinity, 12Riven: The Psi-Climinal of Integral, and Code_18. It was originally released in Japan on August 29, 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast, and was later ported to Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Portable, Android, and iOS. A localization of the Microsoft Windows version was released by Hirameki International in North America in 2005.
The game follows Takeshi Kuranari and a boy with amnesia who is referred to as ""the Kid"", who are trapped inside an underwater theme park together with a group of other people after a leak has flooded parts of the park; they cannot contact people on the surface, and due to high water pressure, the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours. The gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story, at certain points making choices that affect its direction, leading to one of several possible endings.
The development team included director Takumi Nakazawa, writer and planner Kotaro Uchikoshi, character designer Yuu Takigawa, and composer Takeshi Abo. Because the science fiction aspects of Never 7 had been positively received, Ever 17 was made with a larger focus on science fiction. A remake, simply titled Ever 17, was developed by 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011, with the original's 2D sprites replaced by 3D models; this change was done as 3D models were seen as being easier to animate.

Strange Adventures in Infinite Space (SAIS) was released in 2002 by James Ernest and Cheapass Games. It was created by Rich Carlson, Iikka Keränen and Bill Sears--aka, Digital Eel (but you knew that).
SAIS generates a different interstellar region every time the game is played. Stars, planets, black holes, nebula mass, alien patrols, items, lifeforms and other encounters are randomized for each new Strange Adventure.
Playing time: 5-20 minutes
Number of players: solo
Difficulty: variable
Replayability: infinite
SAIS features:
+ 21 different ship types
+ 69 different weapons, drives, shields, gadgets and artifacts
+ 18 alien lifeforms
+ 17 different planet and star types
+ 7 unique alien races
SAIS was the first science fiction/space roguelike (or roguelite) and the second roguelike (at least, on this continent) to be set in a realm other than Tolkienesque fantasy (the first was Jeffrey R. Olson's  post-apocalyptic roguelike, Alphaman, released in 1995).
SAIS was innovative in many ways. One example is how it handles game failure. Instead of being many hours in length as typical roguelikes are, SAIS plays to its conclusion in less time than it takes to eat lunch. (Hence the game's tag line, Explore the Galaxy...in Twenty Minutes or Less!) This eases the frustration of permadeath (and, in fact, evokes a ""just one more potato chip"" response), yet sustains the tension and ""every step counts"" aspect that we all like about it.
Many thanks to Chris Collins for creating the new SAIS builds. In fact, let's all give him a big hand right now, okay? (This is labor-of-love stuff, folks.)
Strange Adventures is free, DRM-free and ready to be shared, so everyone can play it. Don't let its ""size"" fool you. SAIS is a subtle and challenging roguelike that game guru Ernest Adams called a perfect short game.
Experience the little game that did. The game that opened the door just a crack, yet wide enough to allow a new roguelike subgenre to emerge. One which would eventually give us classics like FTL.
Note: this special release includes most if not all of the mods created by the SAIS community for the game. Check out The Urluquai Crusade and Even Stranger Adventures in Infinite Space, and more.
Also note: this version runs (mostly) uniformly on Windows, macOS and Linux from the same codebase.
The original Strange Adventures in Infinite Space webpage is still available here, though much of its content is dated and many of its links are now irrelevant or defunct. The original versions of SAIS can be found here, and the original SAIS source code, here.  Also see the SAIS Galactic Guidebook for gameplay help and other nifty details.
Lastly, two sequels were created by Digital Eel based on Strange Adventures--Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space (2005) and Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars (2015). Both games improved aesthetic aspects of the series and built on what came before, but the essential gameplay remained unchanged.

34625,war-and-peace,War and Peace,2002-12-12,,0.0,1,0,6,0,0,"WAR AND PEACEAVALON DIGITAL has captured the look, feel, challenge, and excitement of the classic board game War and Peace and brought it to life on your computer. Solo mode against the AI in some scenarios allows you to become Napoleon as you lead your armies from the fields of France to the steppes of Russia, and from the deserts of Egypt to the mountains of Spain. Or you stand against him as Blucher, Kutuzov, the Duke of Wellington, or any of a score of other famous generals as you plan your strategies to turn the tide of the Napoleonic Wars. And you can play all scenarios and campaigns in multiplayer (2 players).
Fight on land and at sea in short scenarios that cover every major strategic operation from 1796 to 1815, or do it all in a grand campaign that may – or may not – end on the field of Waterloo.
SCALE
War and Peace is a monthly turn-based, hex-based (40 miles each), strategic game.
Dozens of individually named and rated generals lead armies composed of abstract strength points each representing roughly 5,000 men infantry or cavalry and their intrinsic artillery.
Every major – and minor – power of the Napoleonic Wars is represented with its own set of individual pieces, each of which is depicted by square counters illustrated with a soldier attired in the uniform unique to their nation and type.
The mix of forces includes everything from Spanish partisans and Prussian Landwehr on up to Russian Cossacks and Napoleon's Old Guard, and more.
The game also includes squadrons of ships of the line and transports with which players can wage both a global naval struggle – or recreate the situations that led to the epic clashes at the Nile, Copenhagen, and, of course, Trafalgar.
CONTENT
The game contains
Different playing modes: solitaire play against the AI
All the historical scenarios from the boardgame. Some have been thoroughly tested to be solo against AI (and can also be played in multiplayer mode), others are 2-players multiplayer-only for now (the Solo vs AI will come during the next months).

An elegant, easy-to-understand on-screen guide that will walk you through every sequence of play and help you better understand the nuances and depth of choices and strategies available.
Available in English and in French upon release, with Spanish, German, Russian and Chinese coming in a few months afterwards.
No internet connection required to play against the AI
THE GRAND CAMPAIGN GAME – WAR AND PEACE 1805-1815: a complete campaign covering the entire Napoleonic Wars, with production, diplomacy, foreign wars, land and naval warfare.
2 Players MP Only: this campaign is only playable in multiplayer mode for now, as the AI work on a project of this scope is daunting and will be made over time.
We prefer to have a playable 2-player multiplayer mode rather than an unfinished and unsatisfactory AI that would not render justice to the game.
PLAY DURATION
Estimated Playtime: 1 to Many Hours.
HISTORY
Although first published in 1980 by the Avalon Hill Company, War and Peace has continued to evolve thanks to a dedicated fan base whose contributions have enhanced the game while retaining the original core set of basic rules. AVALON DIGITAL has taken the most recent of those versions, the 6th Edition which came out in 2021 and faithfully adapted it to the computer. Original designer Mark G. McLaughlin and his more recent co-designer, John Gant, have shepherded the board game through the latest of its six iterations.
The original rules and scenarios remain intact, with additional scenarios set in Italy and the Levant to recreate Napoleon's early campaigns. Anyone who loved the board game will find the system familiar in every way.
John thoroughly revised and enhanced the original grand campaign for the 5th and 6th editions, with Mark's wholehearted approval and gratitude. In order to further ensure that they get every aspect of War and Peace correct, AVALON DIGITAL has retained Mark as one of the lead playtesters and consultants for the computer version of his classic and much-beloved design.
War and Peace by AVALON DIGITAL is more than just a simple port of a board game to the computer; it is also a labor of love by an international team of historians and wargamers for whom this game is THE game on the Napoleonic Wars.
ONGOING AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
As mentioned above, the biggest challenge for a development team in a game like War and Peace is to create an AI that can prove to be challenging to players. We and the beta testers of the game (recruited from the Kickstarter campaign, see below) found a good balance and status in 6 of the game’s scenarios. For the other scenarios and campaign, the AI is still work in progress and we felt safer to keep the 2-players multiplayer version only for release.
Our development team, who has created the acclaimed Carrier Battles game is working hard and continuously on the AI and will provide regular free updates to it.
We conducted a survey last Spring to see with our testers and backers if they wanted the game to release now, or wait till everything was in place to do so. Most wanted the immediate release, as they feel the game is good enough to be a wonderful experience, and a current release will increase the number of potential players to join in multiplayer sessions.

In the game, the player takes control of an advanced helicopter gunship as a part of the Fire Blade task force, which in the arc of the game's story is responsible for fighting terrorism. The enemies of the game are the United Eastern States, who are believed to be building terrorist training camps and factories for weapons of mass destruction.
The game is similar in many respects to ThunderHawk: Operation Phoenix. However, in Fire Blade, the player is forced to be far less cautious unless on a stealth mission and is usually pitted against far larger numbers of enemies. The main element of the game is aggressively piloting the player's attack helicopters against large enemy armored formations and completing the main mission objectives, these vary in creativity from simply blowing up a bridge to aiding a special forces team in stopping a train by parking a truck across the tracks and stopping enemy troops from moving it.
A secondary element of the game is FPS-style sniping, when the player's helicopter enters ""stealth mode"" the autocannon is used as a precision sniper weapon that can be used to accurately target individual soldiers, allowing the player to snipe enemy infantry much like in an FPS.
Additional fuel and ammunition for the helicopter's jet boosters and heavier armaments are acquired from destroyed enemy vehicles instead of the more conventional reloading areas from games such as the Strike Series.",,,"Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2",,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer","Kuju Entertainment, Kuju","Nintendo, Midway Games",2002

750379,alien-vendetta,Alien Vendetta,2002-12-26,,0.0,1,0,5,0,0,"Alien Vendetta offers 32 all new levels, ranging from small fast-paced tech-styled ones, to complex medieval- and hellish-themed maps. Variety was to be expected considering several authors had a hand in the making of these maps and as no specific criteria were given to them. AV originated in '96 as a one-man project, but saw many transitions and was eventually made a team effort in August 1999. What started out as a pure ""Hell Revealed"" follower balanced out to be something in-between that and a more classic looking megawad. We decided to put more emphasize on detailed architecture while trying to keep the at times ultra hard gameplay in focus. Admittedly recreating the intensity of ""Hell Revealed"" while trying to create more commonly scaled maps turned out to be quite a challenge. As a result the hardness was tuned down a bit, and fun gameplay became more important than making it as hard as possible. When that's said, AV still holds a somewhat harder skill setting than any serious megawad with the exception of ""Hell Revealed"" and its sequal. In the tougher maps it will indeed challenge the best players on Ultraviolence, and would probably be more frustrating than fun for the common Doomer. Fortunately we put effort into all levels of difficulty, and would advise anyone who is not looking for hordes of monsters (and the need for planning in order to survive) to play skill 2 or 3. AV skill 3 plays much like ""The Plutonia Experiment"" does on its skill 4. Skill 2 would be the favourable pick for anyone who wants to have a more relaxed journey through the levels (be warned tho, even on skill 2 AV holds a few surprises =) Altho map continuity exists between a few levels we decided to go for variation instead of a one-themed 32 level scenario. This difference in scenery from map to map hopefully contributes to less redundant gameplay. Each level is completable from scratch, but when approached this way it should be noted that secret areas become vital for health and ammo supply. The first episode consists of a variety of ""earthly"" themed maps/bases and a few tech facilities. Difficulty here leans more towards easy even on skill 4, and primarily functions as a warm-up. Episode 2 starts out with a series of techbases and ends up in a more brick styled fashion. The first really hard scenes for the average player will occur in this episode. The final chapter is mainly hell themed and holds the most extreme levels in terms of hardness. A few of these are up to ""Hell Revealed"" difficulty. If you're looking for a challenge combined with atmospheric levels, Alien Vendetta should be right up your alley.

978583,live-for-speed,Live for Speed,2002-08-18,,0.0,1,0,4,0,0,"Live for Speed is a serious racing simulator. No arcade modes, no steering aids - YOU have to do the driving.

The forces affecting the car's motion are simulated individually at each wheel. We recommend the use of a steering wheel, because although you can use the keyboard and/or mouse, a wheel and pedals provide a lot more accuracy. The force feedback sent to the steering wheel is calculated directly from the forces, with no canned effects. This allows you to feel what is happening at the contact patch between your tyres and the road, helping you to get closer to the limit without exceeding it too much!

When you have a lot of speed and you approach a corner, you must brake well in advance or you will end up somewhere you don't want to be! You need to find the best way through any sequence of bends by going through them many times. There's always more to learn.

You can race alone, against the clock, or against the AI drivers. But for many people the real fun is to be found online, racing real people, in multiplayer mode. LFS makes it very easy for you to do so. Simply click ""List of Hosts"", select a server that looks interesting and join instantly. Many hosts run short races of a few laps, so there isn't usually too long to wait for a restart. Most public hosts allow you to join mid-race. Just make sure you keep out of the way of the people who started the race before you joined! There are also several online racing leagues you can take part in if you are looking for something with a more competitive edge.

A serious simulator obviously requires a very good physics simulation to provide the thrill and fun of real racing. This is done by including all aspects that are important to racing. Live for Speed is in constant development. S3 is the third step towards our vision of the finished product, and already does a very good job in simulating real racing. Many aspects are covered - comprehensive setup possibilities, fuel usage, tyre wear, crash damage, different surface types, intriguing racing environments, different car classes and so on. All this makes sure you have plenty to practise with and spend time on, learning the flow of the tracks. Don't forget to plan your pitstops - find out how much fuel your car uses per lap and how your tyres behave on any track, with your particular car setup and driving style.

You can download Live for Speed from official website. The software will initially act as a demo, allowing access to three cars and one track environment only. To access the other content, you will need to buy a license upgrade.
S1, S2 and S3 licenses, as well as other products, can be purchased from official website.",https://www.lfs.net/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveForSpeed/,PC,"Simulation, Sports, Racing, Indie","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Open World, First-Person, Partial Controller Support, Online multiplayer, Controller, Includes level editor, Moddable, Realistic, Physics, VR, Driving, Artificial Intelligence, VR Support",LFS Team,LFS Team,2002

Although the Revolution brought with it new laws and some semblance of representative government, there are some places that never change: the dark hole known as prison. Into that hell a boy called Guys is sent. The crime is murder, and the sentence, life without the possibility of parole.

However, Guys is innocent of this crime. He was living his life as he always did, running through the city and stealing to survive when he was caught by a policeman. Before he knew what was happening he was accused of a crime he knew nothing about, hauled before a dishonest judge and found guilty of the heinous crime. But just who was killed, and why?

In prison, Guys is made to endure a world of violence and betrayal as he fights desperately to survive. Inside that world of fear and loathing, he endures in his quest for justice for himself. He finds help in unlikely places -- from alcoholic lawyers and insane men in the prison with him. Eventually he begins to realize the scope of the diabolical plot he's fallen into, but even as he works to uncover the truth, he despairs of that which he has lost. And every day, he struggles for dignity and survival, while the powerful interests who put him here look on with smirking amusement.

""I just want to be free...""

Will his strength and determination be enough to break through the hearts of his fellow prisoners? Will he be able to finally uncover the truth and find salvation?",,,PC,Casual,"Visual Novel, NSFW, adult, eroge, Yaoi",,JAST USA,2002

The gameplay is similar to Metal Slug and other run and gun games. It lacks the vehicles that were an element of Metal Slug.

In addition, there are some unique features in the game. Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges the player's pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until players press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost their shield power.

It includes an editable roster, but you cannot name the players as, traditionally, NCAA athletes are referred to as ""John Doe"" and not by their full name. There are basic game modes such as the dynasty or jump into a quick play. Dynasty is where you lead your team over the course of a year to the National Championship. Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a ""Division 1"" powerhouse.

Also, very limited external devices can be used to add on to the already existing game features, although it does allow for four player options through direct link cables.

Watch as your T34s roll across the steppes of Central Russia or fight your way building to building in the Battle of Stalingrad. It simulates battles on the Eastern Front from German invasion of Russia with Operation Barbarossa in June of 1941 until the final days of the war in Berlin May 1945. Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin allows the player to lead the soldiers of seven nationalities (German, Soviet, Finnish, Hungarian, Romanian, Italian and Polish) into battle, using historical Tables of Equipment and Organization (TO&E), surroundings, and combat results.
Combat is simulated in turns using science and behavioral logic, not “gamey” conventions such as hit points, armor ratings, tables of resolution, or other overly simplistic concepts.  The pioneering “WeGo” gameplay system helps avoid many of the realism problems of other games by requiring both players to submit their orders and having them carried out simultaneously.  The resulting 60 second replayable “movie” can be viewed from any angle and perspective before moving onto the next turn.
Play stand alone battles, connected battles, or “Quick Battles” created on-the-fly.  The full featured Editor allows you to create your own battles.  A large amount of community generated battles and Mods are available for free download.  In addition to the very challenging single player mode, two people can play on one computer, TCP/IP network connection, or via PBEM.
Apply common sense and intuition and don’t expect ""gamey"" tactics to work - no matter how successful they were in other games. You will be forced to plan ahead, use timing, suppression fire, feints and flanking attacks to survive, let alone to win. When planning your moves, think about what would work in the real world, not what would work in other games.

It also includes games that were originally released by Absolute Entertainment and Imagic, as well as various homebrew games. The Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions are titled Activision Anthology: Remix Edition, and include the most games. The PlayStation Portable version is titled Activision Hits Remixed.
The game features the original gameplay of the Atari 2600 emulated on modern systems. After achieving high scores in some of the games, the player can unlock special modes where the colors are distorted, or the game is projected on a rotating cube as added difficulty.
Activision Anthology features a virtual kid's bedroom as the main menu. The player can select several viewpoints to check highscores, choose a video game cartridge from a rotating stand, change the background music on a virtual tape deck, or change game settings while being zoomed in on a virtual Atari 2600. The virtual tape deck features several licensed 1980s music tracks. The music from the virtual tape deck can be mixed with the Atari 2600 game audio so both are audible to simulate playing the game on TV while having the tape running in the background.
Six Activision-produced Atari 2600 titles were not included in Activision Anthology, likely due to outside ownership of their respective licenses. The excluded games are Commando, Double Dragon, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Kung Fu Master, and Rampage, although Capcom did give Activision rights to put Commando in the PlayStation 2, Windows, and Mac OS X versions of Activision Anthology. Ghostbusters II was cancelled before Activision could release it, but Salu released it in Europe under their name in 1992. The Absolute Entertainment title Pete Rose Baseball was renamed Baseball, presumably due to licensing rights regarding Pete Rose's name, as well.",,,Game Boy Advance,,"Singleplayer, 2 players","Aspyr Media, Digital Eclipse, MumboJumbo, Code Mystics, Barking Lizards, MacPlay, Contraband Entertainment, Barking Lizards Technologies, Nikkō Europe",Activision Blizzard,2002

Plenty of hammed up cheesey moments with transformation sequences and character dialogue as the bug eyed Kamen squares up to latex lizards and rubber suited rogues. A nice pinnacle of the series on the Playstation with smooth combos making for an enjoyable romp.

Story of the show:

Kazami Shiro was a 22-year-old biochemistry major at Jonan University, Tokyo. One night, he accidently witnesses the brutal murder of a road worker. Little did Kazami know that this event would change the entire course of his life.

The murderer was no ordinary man, but member of the secret society known only as DESTRON. Destron is, at its heart, a terrorist organization, formerly known as the GELSHOCKER ALLIANCE (a joint organization between SHOCKER and GELDAM), whose objective is the conquest of the world, the destruction of civilization, and the enslavement of mankind.

Because of what he saw, Kazami was targeted for assassination. After several failed attempts, while away, Destron attacked his family home. He returned, only to watch helplessly as his parents and sister were horribly slaughtered...

It was at this moment that his mentor Hongo Takeshi came to the rescue. With the words ""Rider...Henshin!"", Hongo Takeshi transformed and revealed his true identity - KAMEN RIDER!

Kazami was now burning for revenge. He pleaded with his mentor to transform him into the cyborg - half human, half grasshopper - freak, the KAMEN RIDER. But the Kamen Riders were reluctant to do so. Being a Kamen Rider meant that one would never experience life as a true mortal man again. The aftermath would be a painful experience...

As our heroes fought their way into a Destron's hideout, they suddenly fell into a trap! Under the Anti-Cyborg beams, the hapless Kamen Riders slowly began to disintegrate. From what seemed almost certain doom, Kazami Shiro came to the rescue! Braving the pain of the burning device, Kazami saved the Kamen Riders by throwing himself into its deadly beams...

With a critically wounded Kazami dying in their arms, the Kamen Riders were left with only one choice - to tranform Kazami Shiro into KAMEN RIDER V3!

The research city of Edward City was completely destroyed in an explosion from the Third Energy reactor—an event far more catastrophic than the previous accident. In response, the government launched a rescue mission to retrieve the research data and any remaining personnel.
To reach Edward City, believed to have been displaced in time by the reactor’s explosion, the government deployed an experimental, untested “time gate” device to send a rescue team back in time. No one could foresee the consequences of this mission—except one person: Regina…

Zapper is an action-packed and addictive game that starts with the “avoid-em-up” game play mechanics of Blitz Games’ own Frogger 2: Swampy’s Revenge, and then takes the action to a whole new level. In this action-adventure game, Zapper (a cricket) hops his way through six interactive worlds in a quest to find his brother, held captive by the evil magpie queen. Dangerous traps and even more dangerous enemies await Zapper. It will take fast-footed skill and timing to conquer all the worlds and survive the final showdown with the magpie queen.
GAME FEATURES:
- Classic “avoid-em-up” game play from the makers of Frogger 2: Swampy’s Revenge: Blitz Games.
- Unique enemies and traps to thwart Zapper on his quest.
