Players traverse vast levels killing any Hell creature they encounter on their way. A wide range of weapons is as the player's disposal, starting with a brass knuckle and finishing with an experimental energy weapon, BFG9000.

The one and only objective of the player is to find the exit of the level. Sometimes a keycard is required to unlock the exit. Upon the completion of the level, the player's performance is evaluated and points are accumulated based on how fast did the player pass the level, how ruthless they did it, how many demons got killed and how many secrets were found.

Worms is a two-dimensional game. The gameplay is similar to the strategies of the time, such as Scorched Earth. The player controls a team of four worms. The objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy team. The player and the AI take turns on which they control a randomly selected worm from their team. During each turn, the player can use any weapon available to them or change the position of a worm. Upon hitting a worm, it's health points are taken away. The worms die on two occasions: if their health points reach zero or they hit the water. The levels are interactive and their landscapes are destructible, which affects the gameplay.

Players have access to a wide variety of weapons. Apart from RPGs, grenades, and UZI, the game features unusual weapons such as banana bombs or explosive sheep. During the game, weapon crates are dropped from the sky. Players also can use tools such as a blowtorch or a drill, that affect the landscape itself.

Once the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface.
What they uncover is anything but routine.
Low, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurtled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante’s inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels.
But no Cocytans.
Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins, and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainty?

The main game, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, earned enthusiastic reviews, won most of the major PC gaming awards in 1996, and sold over 2 million copies.
Later in 1996 Blizzard released an expansion pack Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal for DOS and Mac OS, and a compilation Warcraft II: The Dark Saga for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, provided Blizzard's online gaming service, Battle.net, and replaced the MS-DOS version with a Windows one.
Players must collect resources, and produce buildings and units in order to defeat an opponent in combat on the ground, in the air and in some maps at sea. The more advanced combat units are produced at the same buildings as the basic units but also need the assistance of other buildings, or must be produced at buildings that have prerequisite buildings. The majority of the main screen shows the part of the territory on which the player is currently operating, and the minimap can select another location to appear in the larger display. The fog of war completely hides all territory which the player has not explored. Terrain is always visible once revealed, but enemy units remain visible only so long as they stay within a friendly unit's visual radius.
Warcraft II 's predecessor Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, released in 1994, gained good reviews, collected three awards and was a finalist for three others, and achieved solid commercial success. The game was the first typical RTS to be presented in a medieval setting and, by bringing multiplayer facilities to a wider audience, made this mode essential for future RTS titles. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans laid the ground for Blizzard's style of RTS, which emphasized personality and storyline. Although Blizzard's very successful StarCraft, first released in 1998, was set in a different universe, it was very similar to Warcraft II in gameplay and in attention to personality and storyline. In 1996 Blizzard announced Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, an adventure game in the Warcraft universe, but canceled the game in 1998.

As hostilities died out, more trivial concerns like rebuilding what was lost or dealing with space piracy, became the biggest concerns of the Terran Confederation.

Confed HQ needed the best and decided to recall Colonel Blair to active duty. This is where you come in.
Wing Commander™ 4 is one of the greatest space sims of all time, and some even consider it the greatest one of all. It is one of those games that did everything right. This is one of the few games that actually successfully manages to integrate a lot of FMV into the action, mostly because it uses trained film actors and directors. The combat is straightforward, fluid, and entertaining. The characters are as believable and memorable as they come. The orchestrated music -- just perfect. Finally, its enthralling story is both deep and plausible -- a combination that is often lost in modern games. There is simply no reason not to play this game and, once you do start playing, you will find it hard to think of a reason why you should stop. This version of Wing Commander™ 4: The Price of Freedom features DVD-quality cutscenes.
Arguably the best installment of the Wing Commander™ series and one of the best space sims of all time.

The game was also released for the Sega Saturn in 1998 only in Japan, and for Microsoft Windows in 1998 in Japan. On December 22, 2008, Suikoden was made available on the PlayStation Store for use on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles.
The game centers on the political struggles of the Scarlet Moon Empire. The player controls a Scarlet Moon Empire general's son who is destined to seek out 108 warriors (referred to as the 108 Stars of Destiny) in order to revolt against the corrupt sovereign state and bring peace to a war-torn land. The game is loosely based on the Chinese novel Shui Hu Zhuan, and features a vast array of characters both controllable and not, with over ninety characters usable in combat and many more able to help or hinder the hero in a variety of ways.",,,"PlayStation, SEGA Saturn, PC",RPG,"Singleplayer, exclusive","Sony Interactive Entertainment, Konami Digital Entertainment",Konami,1995

The game was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1995 and later in North American and PAL regions in 1996. It is the third game in the Mega Man X series and the last to appear on the SNES. Mega Man X3 takes place in a fictional future in which the world is populated by humans and intelligent robots called ""Reploids"". Like their human creators, some Reploids involve themselves in destructive crime and are labelled as ""Mavericks"". After twice defeating the Maverick leader Sigma, the heroes Mega Man X and Zero must battle a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler and his utopia of Maverick followers.
Mega Man X3 follows in the tradition of both the original Mega Man series and the Mega Man X series as a standard action-platform game. The player traverses a series of eight stages in any order while gaining various power-ups and taking the special weapon of each stage's end boss. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series in which Zero is a playable character (albeit in limited form) in addition to X. Like its predecessor, Mega Man X2, X3 features the ""Cx4"" chip to allow for some limited 3D vector graphics and transparency effects.
A 32-bit version of Mega Man X3 was released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows in various countries. This version was included on the North American Mega Man X Collection in 2006. The game was also ported to Japanese mobile phones in 2010. Critical reception for Mega Man X3 has been above average. However, the game, particularly the 32-bit version, has received miscellaneous criticism from reviewers for its lack of improvements to the series.
Capcom announced that Mega Man X3 would be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. It was released in North America on August 28, 2014, Japan on October 8, 2014 and the PAL regions on November 6, 2014.",,,"Wii U, PC, SEGA Saturn, PlayStation, SNES",Action,Singleplayer,"Capcom, Minakuchi Engineering","Capcom, Virgin Interactive, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, PAL, Japan, Laguna Video Games",1995

It is the seventh game in the original Mega Man series and the first and only title in the main series to be featured on the 16-bit console. The video game was released in Japan on March 24, 1995 and was localized later in the year in North America and Europe. The game is also available for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection, as well as the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, with a Nintendo Switch version planned for release in Spring 2018.
Picking up directly after the events of Mega Man 6, the plot involves the protagonist Mega Man once again attempting to stop the evil Dr. Wily, who uses a new set of Robot Masters to free himself from captivity and begin wreaking havoc on the world. Along with some help from his old friends, Mega Man finds potential allies in the mysterious robot pair Bass and Treble, who are later revealed to be in league with Wily. In terms of gameplay, Mega Man 7 follows that same classic action and platforming introduced in the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles, but updates the graphics and sound of the series for the more powerful SNES.
According to its creators, Mega Man 7 was only in development for a short time before its release. Keiji Inafune, a noted character designer and illustrator for the franchise, handed off his duties to Hayato Kaji for this installment. Mega Man 7 has received an overall average critical reception. Although many considered it a competent game by itself, a majority of reviewers either called it a simple rehash of previous entries in the Mega Man saga, or considered it inferior to Mega Man X, released on the SNES over a year earlier.",,,"Wii U, SNES, Nintendo 3DS","Action, Platformer",Singleplayer,Capcom,"Capcom, Laguna Video Games",1995

Toy Story on the Mega Drive achieves several technical feats rarely seen on the console, the most notable being a stage played from a first-person perspective (using raycasting techniques similar to those found in Wolfenstein 3D). It also features a sound driver capable of playing Amiga MOD music files, which is used for the title screen and end credits, and also breaks presumed colour limitations in the cutscenes through clever use of the console's shadow/highlight mode.

Based on the X-Men comic book, it is the first fighting game produced by Capcom using characters under license from Marvel Comics. Released around the time of the mid-1990s X-Men animated series, the game features voice actors from the series reprising their roles. The game's plot is based on the ""Fatal Attractions"" story from the comics - players control one of the X-Men or their enemies in their fight against the villain Magneto. They face each of the other characters in the game in best of three one-on-one fighting matches, before battling Juggernaut and then Magneto himself.
The gameplay has much in common with Capcom's previous fighting games, Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Darkstalkers. Children of the Atom adds a combo system that features long combos that can even be performed in mid-air. Also featured in the game are various tactical maneuvers, including the ability for characters to roll. Children of the Atom also introduced multi-tiered fighting environments in which the ground would crumble and characters would fall into lower parts of the level. These concepts and the fast pace of the game would provide the basis for Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom series, which started with the game's successor X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
Ports of the game were released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and personal computers. Of these, the PlayStation version was not as well received as the other versions, suffering from slowdown and missing frames of animation.",,,"PlayStation, SEGA Saturn, PC","Arcade, Fighting",2 players,Capcom,"Capcom, Acclaim Entertainment",1995

It was re-released through the PlayStation Network store on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2007.
Presented in a first-person perspective, the game follows a robotic rabbit named ""Robbit"" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's astrophysicist antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a technology demonstrator for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of ""Spring Man"". Jumping Flash! utilises much of the game engine used in Geograph Seal, an earlier game by Exact for the Sharp X68000 home computer.
Jumping Flash! has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming.

A spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game features Knuckles the Echidna and four other characters known as the Chaotix. The story follows the team in their efforts to prevent Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island. Gameplay is similar to earlier Sonic games: players complete levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies. Knuckles' Chaotix introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether. This tether behaves like a rubber band and must be handled appropriately to maneuver the characters through the stages.
Unlike many other Sonic games, Knuckles' Chaotix was not developed by Sonic Team, but another internal development team at Sega. Development can be traced back to Sonic Crackers, a 1994 prototype for the Sega Genesis which experimented with the tethering mechanics and featured Sonic and Tails. The concept was retained when development transitioned to the 32X under the working title Knuckles' Ringstar. Sonic and Tails were removed from the game and replaced by Knuckles and four other characters, including Mighty the Armadillo, who first appeared in the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993).
Critical reception to Knuckles' Chaotix has been mixed. Critics found the tethering physics cumbersome, although some appreciated it as an attempt by Sega to innovate in the series. It is seen as the last in the ""classic"" 2D style of Sonic games before the series moved to 3D. Some characters and concepts introduced in the game were featured in later Sonic games and media.

It released in March 1995 in Japan and North America, and in July of the same year for Europe and Australia. The game received mixed to positive reviews, with reviewers citing its length and addictive nature as a positive, but its grid sizes and absence of typical Mario elements as a negative.

A classic galactic conquest and turn-based strategy video game where you are the leader of a race of intelligent beings building large spaceships for interplanetary and interstellar travel through warp points between star systems.
You will meet extraterrestrial races while fighting for survival and conducting diplomacy signing treaties between empires, trade agreements to full-blown partnerships, and even create protectorates.
In Space Empires, the player assumes the role of the single leader of a race of intelligent beings that has recently acquired the technology required to build large fully space-based ships for interplanetary and interstellar travel.
Starting out with only a few possible hull sizes for their ships, on which they can place any number of components to essentially create a unique ship, the player can research new hull sizes and components to use with them, eventually being able to build ships ten times the size of his original hull size.
The components available to the player can vary greatly, from ship bridges, long-range scanners and shield generators to emergency supply components that, when used, will be destroyed but will allow a ship to continue moving for a longer time, and of course, weapons of various kinds, boarding parties, cloaking devices right up to Dyson sphere construction material and star-destroying devices.
The player can meet extraterrestrial races (which will inevitably happen as the player expands their realm) and conduct diplomacy with them. Treaties can be signed between two empires, varying from the basic trade agreement to full-blown partnerships and even protectorates. The player can also conduct intelligence operations, from simple information gathering missions, to ship bombs, to inciting rebellion on a planet.
Interstellar travel in Space Empires is not faster-than-light drive based, but instead relies on anomalies called ""warp points"", essentially wormholes between two star systems. Warp points are naturally occurring but a player can open and close these warp points if she or he has the appropriate technologies.",,,PC,Strategy,"Singleplayer, Sci-fi, Exploration, Tactical, Retro, Space, Futuristic, Turn-Based Strategy, Management, Base Building, Turn-Based Combat, Turn-Based Tactics, Economy, Grand Strategy, 4X",Malfador Machinations,Strategy First,1995

It is the second entry in the Mystery Dungeon series, following 1993's Torneko no Daibōken. It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1995 in Japan; a Nintendo DS remake was published by Sega in 2006 in Japan and 2008 in the West.
The player takes the role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas on his way to the Land of the Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and characters in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking or moving. If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off.
The game was developed with the core concept of repeated play, with the player having to improve their items through multiple playthroughs, and was seen as a way for the developers to more fully express the Mystery Dungeon series than with other titles in the series, which feature already existing game worlds that Chunsoft cannot change. The game was released to mixed reviews upon release, with reviewers criticizing the high difficulty and visuals, but praising how the game creates deep gameplay experiences through simple core gameplay concepts. Later, some publications called Shiren the Wanderer among the best in its genre and platform.",,,"Game Boy, SNES",RPG,Singleplayer,Chunsoft,"SEGA, Chunsoft",1995

The game had origins in DC Comics as well as the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the best hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain nicknamed F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD.
The game was notorious for its macabre sense of humor, over-the-top violence and gore, and lighting effects, but was often criticized for the repetitiveness of its gameplay.

34557,the-civil-war,The Civil War,1995-01-01,,0.0,0,0,11,0,0,"Civil War is an old-school game that simulates the American Civil War from its start in April 1861 until the presidential election on 8th November 1864, when President Lincoln was re-elected. If you have sufficient strategic and organizational skills then you may be able to force the opposition to surrender prior to the latter date.
You can choose to play as the commander of either the Northern Union or the Southern Confederates. Both sides have their own unique abilities, making it challenging whichever side you choose. The opposition can be provided either by the computer's 'artificial intelligence' or by another player if you have a suitable LAN connection set up between two computers.
The game can be played in two modes:
You can play the entire campaign as a complex strategy game covering the entire east coast of America, starting with a historically accurate deployment of troops. As well as controlling units on any level from Army Commander down to Brigade Commander, you will have to maintain your cities by fortifying them, recruiting new units, and building facilities such as hospitals and supply depots. You will also have naval forces at your disposal, which can be used to bombard enemy towns or cut off supply lines.
On the other hand, you can choose to play one of a number of historical battles, where you control the action at a regimental level, actually viewing the battlefield in a unique 3D representation. All of the major features of the battlefield are represented, and you will be able to see individual soldiers marching or riding their horses, firing their muskets and engaging the enemy.
The battle feature is also incorporated in the full campaign so that when an important battle occurs you have the option to play out the scenario on the battlefield. You may, however, choose to let the computer calculate the results for you.
Both modes of play have a range of realism settings so that you can tailor the game to your own liking, and allow more complex features as your understanding and prowess increases.
Your goal in the campaign mode is to amass victory points, and when you have enough, you win. You gain victory points by capturing cities, both those of your opponent and those who start out as neutral. How many victory points you need depends on the difficulty setting. As noted above the campaign game is turn-based, you give your orders by night and they are carried out by the day. But even though it's turn-based, you don't have time to sit back and relax, carefully pondering what to do next, since there is a time limit. On the higher difficulty levels, you won't have time to issue all the orders you would like, and you will have to prioritize, while on the lower levels you'll have plenty of time to come up with a good strategy.",,,PC,Strategy,"Singleplayer, 2D, Pixel Graphics, Turn-Based Strategy, Turn-Based Tactics, Diplomacy",Dagger Interactive Technologies,"Strategy First, Empire Interactive Entertainment",1995

Despite not being released out of Japan directly (1995), it was featured outside the region as a bonus game in the 'Sonic Gems Collection'- a GameCube title including many other entries.

Bearing both strategy and shooter qualities, Tails' Skypatrol is not quite the traditional platformer. There are no Rings to collect (commonly known to reward extra lives), which instead is a projectile that Tails throws to garner points and extra lives. A new noticeable mechanic is the Flight Meter, which slowly drains as the stages pile on. In order to keep this meter filled and soaring, Tails can find Mint Candy- his favourite treat- scattered across areas to refill his energy.

Gamtec is also responsible for the development of a number of other games, including many for the Gamate handheld system. A version for Super NES was released later, under the name of Squirrel.
It appears to be loosely based upon Capcom's Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, sharing its gameplay mechanics, although it is not licensed by Disney. As in the aforementioned game, the main character must throw crates at the enemies in order to defeat them. Sometimes crates have helpful things like extra fireballs, extra lives, and health boosts. Other times, they have ""power-downs"" that reduce the player's health. Despite some animation issues, this game is considered to be of professional quality. Players are given a limited amount of lives and continues to beat the game with; it takes half as many games to gain an extra life in two-player mode as opposed to the single-player mode. This video game is divided into seven acts; with an elephant denomined Barnett as the final boss of the game.
This game was eventually used as the basis for the unofficial Mega Drive Super Mario World game. Two of the levels in Squirrel King have their background music based on that of the video game Donkey Kong Country, while in Squirrel, all of the game's sound effects and soundtrack were taken from Super NES video game Bonkers.
A hack version of Super Mario World, also known as Super Mario Bros. (both titles appear in-game) also exists, which is a copy of Squirrel King and uses ripped graphics from Super Mario Bros.. Newly drawn sprites to make the Squirrel King characters look more appropriate are used as well. Despite its overhauled appearance, the gameplay was unchanged, so, unlike the original Super Mario Bros. game it resembles, Mario and Luigi are unable to stomp on enemies and must instead throw crates at them. Instead of the rabbit and the monster, bowser is the replacement of them as the first and second boss, and in the hack, the bird on the machine is the forth boss and the pig is the third boss.",,,Genesis,Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Gamtec,,1995

When this happens, energy units are deducted from the Star Ranger's life-support system, and a short clip is shown in which an old man - played by Ben Zeller, the prospector and stagecoach driver in Mad Dog McCree and Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold, respectively - gives general advice and scolds the player for the mistake made.",,,3DO,Arcade,"Multiplayer, Space, planet, Dog",American Laser Games,American Laser Games,1995

Also, players are selected to the All-Star Game purely based on statistics from the first half of the regular season. Unlocking a code allows a fictional team in exhibition mode.
In Japan, this game is sponsored by Hideo Nomo and is called Nomo's World Series Baseball in English and Nomo Hideo no World Series Baseball in Japanese.

The Game & Watch Gallery series, known in Japan and Australia as the Game Boy Gallery (ゲームボーイギャラリー) series, is a series of compilations of some of Nintendo's original Game & Watch titles first released in 1995. Five installments have been released, all for systems in the Game Boy line; three of these games have also been released on the Virtual Console for Nintendo 3DS. From Game & Watch Gallery onward, the games feature Game & Watch games in two styles: Classic, which features faithful reproductions of the original games, and Modern, which gives the games a different visual style using characters from the Super Mario Bros. series; however, not all Game & Watch games included in a particular game include a Modern style. Also, the titles often feature actual galleries explaining the history of the Game & Watch system and the various games released for it. The first four titles in the series also feature Super Game Boy borders which mimic the original Game & Watch casing designs. While originally released under the title Game Boy Gallery in Australia, the Virtual Console releases use the title Game & Watch Gallery.
Beginning in 1998, Nintendo licensed a series of small standalone LCD remakes of the original Game & Watch games called Nintendo Mini Classics.
In the early 2000s, several Game & Watch titles were planned for re-release as Game & Watch-e (a series of Nintendo e-Reader cards); however, only one ever was.
The Game & Watch Collection series for Nintendo DS is a set of two games that were available exclusively from Club Nintendo.

In The Depths of Dejenol you will create characters from a choice of races, oversee their training in skills taught by one or more of a dozen guilds, and lead them into a mysterious dungeon on a nearly endless mission of exploration, mapping, and looting.

Along the way, you will encounter hundreds of exotic and terrifying creatures. And when properly trained, you will be able to charm or vanquish them as you see fit.

As you venture deeper into the mines, you will discover rare and powerful artifacts. Artifacts that you can sell for considerable profit or use to cast magical spells.

The deeper you explore, the more excitement and challenge you’ll find. But proceed with caution, or you may discover why so few explorers return from... The Depths of Dejenol.

It was published in Japan by Sony Music Entertainment in January 1995, followed by a North American and European release in September 1995 by Sony Computer Entertainment as a launch game for the console. Kimitaka Matsumae, former member of Sega's in-house music group S.S.T. Band, wrote the game's soundtrack.
The story follows an International Peacekeeping Force's White Lightning team leader Matt Coda, as he attempts to stop a scientist Dr. Kim from conducting unethical genetic engineering research. As the game progresses, the eponymous Kileak is revealed to be an ancient extraterrestrial creature that is the common ancestor of all life on Earth. The player controls an armored SJ 107 assault suit through the series of floor levels within a South Pole observation base. Each floor is connected by an elevator, which the player must find in order to proceed to the level below. The suit is equipped with various weapons, some of which require the suits battery power to operate.
The game received mixed reviews, with criticism targeted towards its monotonous level design and limited control scheme, while praise was given to its 3D graphics and pre-rendered cutscenes. A sequel, Epidemic, was released in Japan in December 1995, and in North America the following year.

""Super Big Brother"") is a Japanese video game series originally developed by Masaya and published by NCS Corp. The first game debuted in 1992 for the PC Engine system. The game's sequels and spin-offs later appeared on the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, WonderSwan, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Mainly consisting of side-scrolling shoot 'em ups in the vein of Gradius, the Cho Aniki series is best known for its homoerotic overtones, wacky humor and vivid, surreal imagery. Most of the games have never seen release outside Japan.
For various reasons, the popularity of the Cho Aniki games has endured since the series' debut. Highlights of the various games include in-game music, innovative control schemes or sheer kitsch value. In Japan, these games are examples of baka-ge, a type of kuso-ge. ""Baka-ge"" literally means ""idiot game"" while ""kuso-ge"" literally means ""shitty game"" or ""shit game"". Baka-ge's appeal lies in its campiness.
Occasionally, the title is transliterated as ""Choaniki"", ""Chou Aniki"", or (erroneously) ""Cho Eniki"".

The plot of the game involves the player (Peterson) taking part in a STAAR (Strategic Tactical Advanced Alien Response) military incursion to prevent aliens, known as the Kronn, and alien-created zombies from taking over the Area 51 military facility.

Gameplay

A screenshot showing the player engaging in a battle with multiple opponents.
This game takes the player through several sections of the facility, including a warehouse and tunnels. The player character is tasked, along with fellow Special Tactical Advanced Alien Response (STAAR) members Lieutenant Stephanie Grant and Sergeant Major Marcus Bradley, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must defeat genetically modified zombie soldiers and space aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members. If nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter mode is started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels.[5]

There are five types of weaponry available. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player character is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol.

Grenades are hidden in crates and bonus rooms. When used, they destroy most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a maximum of nine grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with ""flammable"" warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies. By shooting certain objects in the correct sequence, players can unlock shooting exercises, weapon stashes, and bonus items that are not available in the main game plot. Other backdoors allow players to warp ahead to later levels instead of following the game's otherwise linear path.

There are many types of aliens/alien zombies including ones that shoot, punch, fire rockets, and throw things like bricks, grenades, and barrels. Purple alien/alien zombies require more hits than other targets.

Development

An Area 51 arcade cabinet.
In 1994, publisher Atari Games was in desperate need of a hit, having gone years without a single profitable game and losing most of their most talented developers to rival publisher Electronic Arts. As such, they directed Ed Logg to create a light gun shooter, which was one of the most popular game genres in arcades at the time.[6] However, Logg also left to join Electronic Arts while the game, Bounty Hunter, was still unfinished.[6] At this point executives at Atari Games felt it would be safer to entrust development to an external team, and approached Mesa Logic head Robert Weatherby about his team (Hector Silva, James Mestemaker, Guy Fumagali and James Web) taking over Bounty Hunter. After playing Bounty Hunter and finding it underwhelming, Weatherby asked for a few months to come up with and develop a pitch for his own gun game concept, to which Atari agreed.[7]

Weatherby received the inspiration for the Area 51 concept from an article in Popular Science called ""Searching for the Secrets of Groom Lake"".[7]

Originally the data from the game was to be streamed from a CD player using Cinepak for compression, but since this could only produce a letterboxed display, lead programmer Charlie Grisafi opted to instead run the game on a COJAG (a modified Atari Jaguar used in arcade games) interfaced with a hard disk drive and using Grisafi's own custom compression software.[7] Grisafi recalled:
The amount of rendering required was a huge obstacle. It was originally done by Robert [Weatherby]'s team in Texas but as time went on, the raw horsepower required to do it all became more than they had. I realized that the Silicon Graphics workstations of all the different teams at Atari in California could be a huge resource for doing this. Atari helped us coordinate getting access to all of the systems in the building after hours when the other teams weren't using their systems, so every night we would take over and turn all the SGI systems at Atari into a large render farm.[7]

The game uses digitized video stored on the on-board hard disk, and gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.

While the STAAR members were rendered with motion capture, the assorted enemies were created with stop motion animation by Sneaky Pete Kleinow.[7][8]

Sequel and related games
In 1998, Atari Games released an arcade sequel titled Area 51: Site 4 and re-released the first game as part of one machine called Area 51/Maximum Force Duo that also included Maximum Force.[9] In 2005, a first-person shooter which shares the name and uses the original as an inspiration was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC by Midway Games. It features a more sophisticated storyline and the voices of David Duchovny, Marilyn Manson, and Powers Boothe. The original arcade game makes a brief appearance here as well. In 2007, Midway released BlackSite: Area 51 to multiple platforms.

Ports
In 1996, the game was ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC. Because Atari Games had been purchased by WMS Industries in the interim,[10] these versions were published by WMS's Midway Games subsidiary. It was re-released on the PlayStation in 2001 by Midway as part of their Midway Classics range.[citation needed] Tiger Electronics later released a handheld version of the game with an LCD screen and small light gun.[citation needed]

The PlayStation version supports fullscreen play, while the Saturn version has a border covering about 15% of the screen. The Saturn version supports all of the console's light guns. The PlayStation version supports the Konami Justifier, but not the Namco GunCon.

Despite the arcade version running on a modified Atari Jaguar, it was never ported on to the system itself.[11]

Area 51 was a major hit in the arcades, selling over 20,000 cabinets.[7] Executive producer Mark Pierce recalled that the home versions had above average sales by the standards of console light gun games (which typically did not sell as well as other arcade ports, since players could not get the full experience without purchasing a light gun for the console).[6]

Next Generation's review of the arcade version stated that ""Area 51 provides shooters with what they want"", noting in particular the dark and varied levels, realistic and graduated scenery, intriguing story themes, and fun power-ups. Despite this, the reviewer concluded that the game ""stands up better against shooters of the past like Virtua Cop 1 and Mad Dog McCree, and not the current crop.""[20] The game took the number one slot in the December 1995 ""Player's Choice"" chart of RePlay Magazine.[23]

The Saturn port received middling reviews. Critics typically commented that the game is good fun on its own terms but does not compare well to Virtua Cop 2, which was released for the Saturn at roughly the same time.[16][18][22][24] The graphics received mixed remarks due to the graininess of the FMV and the presence of screen borders,[16][18][22][24] and like most console light gun games it was criticized as having very low longevity.[16][18][22][24] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly also found the game too easy, though they praised the retention of all the secret rooms from the arcade version.[16] Lee Nutter summarized in Sega Saturn Magazine, ""As shoot 'em ups go Area 51 is not a bad effort, but outclassed by the [Virtua] Cop games in every conceivable way.""[22] Air Hendrix gave Area 51 one of its more positive reviews in GamePro, praising its frenzied pace and concluding, ""Area 51's sizzling action easily overcomes its sizable flaws. It's a must for diehard shooters and a superb rental for everyone else.""[24] Jeff Kitts of GameSpot called it ""a topnotch shooter"". Unlike other reviewers, he found the game's challenge and multiple difficulty levels give it sufficient longevity, and deemed the graphics ""superb"", citing the constant action and plot development playing out in the photorealistic backgrounds.[17] In a 1998 review of the Saturn version, IGN, while remarking that the game lacks sufficient playtime or extras to last long and does not measure up to Virtua Cop 2, found it to be a well-designed and fun experience in both single player and two-player mode.[18]

Steve Bauman of Computer Games Magazine gave the PC version two stars out of five and wrote, ""This is a perfect example why you don't convert some arcade games to the PC."" Bauman called the game ""repetitive and boring"" because of its lack of the arcade version's light gun.[19]

The PlayStation version was largely ignored by contemporary reviewers. A Next Generation reviewer criticized the conversion, but mainly emphasized that Area 51 as a 1997 console game lacked the excitement it had aroused as an arcade game in 1995. He did, however, praise the music and sound effects.[21]

In a retrospective review of the arcade version, Brad Cook of AllGame wrote, ""Not only is this game fun, it's not incredibly hard either. [...] The graphics are extremely well done, and it's very fast-paced."" He also praised the storyline, attract mode, and varied backgrounds.[12] Anthony Baize of AllGame called the PlayStation version ""very exciting."" Baize remarked that while the graphics are not as good as the arcade version, they are still solid, and the unlimited continues gives it an advantage over the arcade version.[13] AllGame praised the Saturn version's music and sound, and recommended that players use a light gun instead of a joypad.

Game developers Sting' were contracted by the publishing conglomerate Kadokawa Shoten for a tie-in game for their gaming magazine Marukatsu Super Famicom, which had recently just started pushing a new mascot named Ruka (with an accompanying mini manga in each issue) to try and help boost sales of the magazine. 

Rather than create a new game from scratch, Sting opted to re-brand the already existing ""The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates"" game they had released the year before, which had not been released in Japan. The gameplay and level design between the two games is ultimately the same, though the story, sprites, and artwork were completely redone, as well as music. 

Ruka-chan was a fiesty teenage-looking demon girl that was actually over 1000 years old. Her task was to rid the world of demons and monsters that were causing more trouble than she was. Ruka's boss Enma, the Buddhist deity charged with judging the souls of the dead - an Asian St. Peter, as it were - is represented as a giant red oni in a business suit and jokingly referred to by Ruka as ""Elvis"". One night his body was stolen by a handsome boy known only as, well, ""Body"" to be used for nefarious purposes along with his army of monsters. Left with only his head, Enma scolds and demands Ruka to get his body back or else he'll gladly take hers as a replacement.",,,SNES,"Action, Platformer",,"Sting, Sting Entertainment","Taito, Kadokawa Shoten",1995
