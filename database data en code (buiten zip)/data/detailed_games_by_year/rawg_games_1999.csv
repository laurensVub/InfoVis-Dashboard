The game setting is the same as the one in the original game: the story takes place in the science laboratory called Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico at the same time. However, instead of following the original characters, players are offered to assume the role of Adrien Shephard a Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (initially antagonist organization) operator, who is sent to Black Mesa to prevent an extraterrestrial menace. Nevertheless, shooting scientists is not required, as the main threat comes out of aliens. The overall gameplay has few differences comparing to the one existing in Half-life, as far as it is based on completing the sequence of levels. Although the combat system looks almost the same, it features the non-player character’s assistance so the protagonist will receive support from scientists, security guards, and marines (soldiers, combat medics, and engineers) during firefights or while solving puzzles.

###Plot
Young Lara Croft who is accompanied by professor Werner Von Croy goes to Cambodia to find a mysterious artifact known as Iris. Unfortunately, due to an accident, the professor dies and Lara has to return to Great Britain. 15 years later, Lara opens up an Egyptian tomb where an ancient Egyptian god Set was buried. She incidentally awakens an old god, so now Lara has to get him back to the tomb to prevent the Apocalypse from happening.

###Gameplay

###Previous and next games of the series
Quake (1996)
A first-person shooter, the player controls a nameless fighter, the base of which was attacked by enemies whose common name is Quake.

The game was a breakthrough in 3D video game technology - implemented a fully three-dimensional world.

The game has a single player campaign and multiplayer mode. The first Quake is the ancestor of cybersport, the major championships began to be held on the basis of the game.

The game code was made publicly available, which led to the appearance of a large number of add-ons not related to the creators of the game. There are also official additions.

Quake II (1997)
Quake II, despite the name, is not a continuation of Quake and its additions. The plot of Quake II tells the story of the confrontation between people and the race Stroggs. The player controls the soldier Bitterman.

Despite the similarities in weapons and objects, the enemies and the storyline have nothing in common.

Initially, the creators did not plan to call the game Quake, but due to the fact that many of the names that came to their mind were already used somewhere, they had to dwell on the old name. In addition, their decision was also influenced by the fact that by the time Quake, as a trademark, was able to ensure commercial success.

Quake IV (2005)
The game continues the story of the battle of humanity with the Stroggs. Spaceships and military equipment of earthlings borrowed from the movie ""Star Troopers"", and the overall design of the Stroggs and their equipment (especially living computers with human body parts) is made in the style of Giger's biomechanoids.

The player acts as a paratrooper of Rhino squad involved in a counterattack on the capital planet of the Stroggs.

After Quake IV were created:
Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (2007) is a game in the world of Quake II and Quake IV, events take place 50 years before the events of Quake II. The game is notable for the use of ground and air vehicles.

Quake Champions (2017)
The game introduces a series of champions - characters with unique abilities. There are fourteen Champions in this game.

###Quake III Arena (1999)
The game emphasizes the multiplayer mode. There is a single mode in the game, but it is not full-fledged and consists of battles with bots.

Quake III Arena Story
The mysterious race Vadrigar built the Arena Eternal, and arranges fights for the best gladiators of the world there - this is the favorite entertainment of this race. Gladiators do not die completely - they are reborn, enriched by the experience of the battle, even if the battle was lost.

Quake III Arena Multiplayer Basic Modes
Free For All - classic Deathmatch;
Team Deathmatch - team battle;
Tournament
Capture The Flag

After the discovery of the code, numerous modifications appeared and gained popularity, including DeFRaG - a modification focused on performing various tricks.

There is an official addition to the game Quake III: Team Arena, and the updated version of the game called Quake Live (2010).",,,"Dreamcast, PC, Linux, PlayStation 2, PlayStation, Classic Macintosh","Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Steam Cloud, First-Person, Sci-fi, FPS, Gore, Difficult, Classic, Moddable, Fast-Paced, Competitive, 1990's, Arena Shooter, e-sports","id Software, Digital Anvil, Raster Games","Electronic Arts, SEGA, Bethesda Softworks, Activision Blizzard, Activison, id Software, Acer",1999

###Plot
The game takes place 1500 years after the events of Blood Omen. It tells the story of Raziel, a lieutenant vampire in the Kain's army. Kain almost kills Raziel and throws him down the Lake of the Dead. However, an elder god saves Raziel from death and turns him into a Soul Stealer to help him take revenge on Kain. 

###Gameplay
The game is completely different from its predecessor. The game is played from the third person with the player being able to move it by themselves.

The gameplay is based on the ability to travel between the material and spirit worlds. This allows the player to continue on the game's plot. The item interaction in the spirit world is limited, yet it also benefits Raziel as he can pass the gates that he is unable to go through in the material world. Many of the game's puzzles are based on the differences between these two worlds. The puzzle environment of the material world can be completely different in the spirit one.

The game's combat system is based on the hack and slash principle and consists out of multiple attacks and finishing moves. The enemies of Raziel are divided into three groups: humans, spirit beings, and vampires.

The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  

###Gameplay 
The gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.
While the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members.

The first installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in North America in January 1999, and in Japan and Europe later that year. Silent Hill uses a third-person view, with real-time rendering of 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the console hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics. Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the player character of Silent Hill is an ""everyman"".
The game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill; stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin. Five game endings are possible, depending on actions taken by the player, including one joke ending.
Silent Hill received positive reviews from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, and is also considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made, moving away from B movie horror elements, toward a psychological style of horror emphasizing atmosphere. Various adaptations of Silent Hill have been released, including a 2001 visual novel, the 2006 feature film Silent Hill, and a 2009 reimagining of the game, titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.

As the gorilla Donkey Kong, the player explores the themed levels of an island to collect items and rescue his kidnapped friends from K. Rool. The player completes minigames and puzzles as five playable Kong characters—each with its own special abilities—to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete in deathmatch and last man standing games.
Rare, who had previously developed the Donkey Kong Country games, began development on the 3D Donkey Kong in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's Banjo group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by Nintendo for North America in November and worldwide by December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's Expansion Pak, an accessory that added memory resources. The game had an exceptionally large marketing budget that included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.
The game received universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller during the 1999 holiday season, with 2.3 million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized its emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie, despite Donkey Kong 64's mandatory memory add-on. The game's camera controls also frustrated reviewers. Critics felt that the game did not meet the revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country, but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.
Donkey Kong 64 is remembered as the emblematic example of Rare's ""collect-a-thon"" adventure platformers for the tedium of its collection tasks. A rap song from the game's introductory sequence—the DK Rap—is often cited among the worst songs to feature in a video game.

First released in Japan in April 1999, it was later released as the first Stadium title in Western regions the following year, and is a sequel to the Japanese-only 1998 Nintendo 64 release, Pokémon Stadium. Gameplay is built around a 3D turn-based battling system using the 151 creatures from the Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow.
Using the Transfer Pak accessory that was bundled with the game, players are able to view, organize, store, trade, and battle with their own Pokémon uploaded from Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow. One main focus of the game is completion of the four stadium cups, each of which is a series of three-on-three Pokémon battles against an ordered lineup of opponents. Another battle mode called Gym Leader Castle allows battles against the eight Kanto gym leaders and the Elite Four. Other features of Pokémon Stadium include mini-games, versus-style battles, a hall of fame, compatibility with the Game Boy Printer, and a built-in emulation function for Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow.
Pokémon Stadium went on to become one of the Nintendo 64's best-selling titles, reaching one million copies sold before the end of 2000. Critical reception of the game was mixed, with critics praising the game's visuals but finding fault with the audio quality.

It is the second entry in the Persona series, itself a subseries of the Megami Tensei franchise, and acts as a sequel to the original Persona. The game was re-released in 2011 for the PlayStation Portable. The original version was not localized for western territories, however the PSP version was released in North America and Europe under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2: Innocent Sin.
Innocent Sin takes place in the fictional Sumaru City, focusing on a group of high school students from Seven Sisters High School. The protagonist, Tatsuya Suou, and a group of friends must confront a villainous figure called the Joker, who is causing the spread of reality-warping rumors through the city. The group are aided in their quest by their Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.
Development on Innocent Sin began after the release of the original Persona, and retained most of the original's staff. The game carried over the story themes and basic gameplay mechanics of Persona, while changing and improving on some of the mechanics. The characters were designed by Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima. The original release was not localized due to staff shortages and concerns over its content. Reception to the game was generally positive for its original release, but reviews were more mixed for its remake due to its age. A direct sequel to Innocent Sin, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment, was released in 2000 in Japan and North America.",,,PlayStation,RPG,"Singleplayer, Story, online, Demons, city, party, school","Atlus, Satelight","Atlus, Ghostlight",1999

It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the Saru! Get You! series, the game tells the story of an ape named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through the use of an experimental helmet. Specter produces an army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.
Ape Escape is played from a third-person perspective. Players use a variety of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, traversing across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting to the use of the controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.

It was released on December 22, 1999 in Japan and on August 29, 2000 in North America. Inspired by Norse mythology, Valkyrie Profile follows the titular valkyrie, Lenneth, as she travels through Midgard, collecting the souls of slain heroes to serve either as einherjar or her personal companions for Ragnarok - the battle to decide the fate of all creation - and trains them by fighting monsters and performing additional quests. As she journeys, she learns more about her original human life, removed from her memory upon becoming a Valkyrie.
The game was both a commercial and critical success; it sold over 700,000 copies, and critics praised the deep and complicated gameplay system and the plot. Valkyrie Profile sparked an enhanced port of the game, which was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006 under the name Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. It also led to two other games in the Valkyrie Profile series: a 2006 PlayStation 2 prequel, titled Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria, released in 2006 in Japan and North America and 2007 in Europe, and another prequel titled Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008, March 17, 2009 in North America and on April 3, 2009 in all PAL regions.",,,"PlayStation, Android, iOS, PSP",RPG,"Singleplayer, exclusive","Tose, Tri-Ace","Square Enix, Enix",1999

The game was made with a low budget, prompting the decision to make videos in-between stages that show a man drinking Pepsi, as they were cheap to produce. The game also features 3D cutscenes, which the future visual novel writer Kotaro Uchikoshi created 3D models for. While an American publisher did look into acquiring the rights to publish the game in the United States, it ended up being a Japan-exclusive game.
Reviewers frequently compared the game to other games, including Crash Bandicoot, and commented on its simplicity and its price, which was thought to be low.

Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa'Diel by creating the world around them and completing a number of interrelated quests in order to restore the Tree of Mana.
While incorporating action role-playing elements from the prior games in the series, such as real-time battles, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the world's structure through the Land Make system, generating regions and quests in a non-linear gameplay system rather than a strong main plotline. Legend of Mana was directed by series creator Koichi Ishii, designed by Akihiko Matsui, and produced by veteran Square director and producer Akitoshi Kawazu.
The game had high sales, selling 400,000 copies in its first week of release and 700,000 by the end of 1999. Reviews were less positive than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed.

Initially developed for Windows, it was ported to PlayStation and PlayStation 2 (whose version was titled Theme Park Roller Coaster in North America), as well for Macintosh computers. The Mac version was published by Feral Interactive.
The game was developed because personnel at Bullfrog wanted to bring the original Theme Park up-to-date. Theme Park World features four themes of amusement park, the ability to ride attractions, and an online service that enabled players to share parks. Reception was mostly positive, with reviewers complimenting the sound and visuals, although some were critical of the interface.

The game was developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series.
It was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産, JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.
The game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities.
Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only shown from the waist-down in the original manga.",,,"PlayStation, Dreamcast","Arcade, Fighting","Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Capcom,"Capcom, Virgin Interactive, PAL",1999

Development for the title was headed by series creator Akitoshi Kawazu, with music by Masashi Hamauzu.

Set in the fictional world of Sandail, the game's plot, as well as location and character names, draw heavily from medieval Germanic and Anglo-Saxon influence. The game's plot is divided into two separate stories, with the player given the option to control either Gustave XIII, an exiled would-be heir on a quest to reclaim his throne, or William Knights, a young man investigating the death of his parents, with both scenarios eventually intertwining in a larger plot involving the fate of the world.

Psygnosis hired design studio The Designers Republic to create a simple colour scheme and design for in-game menus and race courses, to create what a Psygnosis staff member called ""a believable future"". The game is one of the few PlayStation titles to run in high-resolution mode, offering crisper graphics and visuals.

The game was re-released in Europe as Wipeout 3: Special Edition in August 2000, which contained additional tracks and content.
The game was positively received on release; critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The high level of difficulty, perceived lack of new content and courses, and paucity of new game features were seen as the game's primary faults.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.
Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series, it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris ""The Bear"" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over one's character in the ring. Also unlike Punch-Out!!, players can choose whichever boxer they want from a rather large selection of characters.
Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one or two letters at a time, until the word ""RUMBLE"" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows; most such actions will yield one letter, though some particularly strong punches may yield more. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special combo called ""Rumble Flurry"", activated by pressing a button combination. Each character's ""flurry"" is unique to them, and consists of a series of punches which does a large amount of damage if landed successfully.
One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game.
The Game Boy Color version was one of the few games for the system to feature built-in rumble.
The Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 versions each have an exclusive boxer: these are, respectively, Jimmy Blood, Gino Stiletto, and J.R. Flurry.

Released for the Dreamcast in 1999, it was the first game for the system to support multiplayer gaming over the internet. The foundation of the gameplay requires the players to place arrows on a board to lead mice into escape rockets while avoiding hazardous cats. The game features single-player modes in which a player must save all the mice on a given board, and also competitive multiplayer modes that pits players against each other in a battle to collect the most mice.
Directed and produced by Yuji Naka, ChuChu Rocket! was developed in part to test the online functionality of the Dreamcast and Sega's servers, as well as experimenting with the Dreamcast's processing power by displaying many characters on screen at once. The knowledge gained from the network portion of the project helped Sonic Team in their development of Phantasy Star Online (2000). ChuChu Rocket! topped the Japanese sales charts its first week on sale in November 1999. When it arrived in the United States, Sega held an online tournament where players could battle against Sega and Sonic Team employees. When the title released in PAL regions, it was given for free to subscribers of Sega's online gaming service there, Dreamarena.
The game was both a commercial and critical success. Critics highlighted the game's chaotic and addictive multiplayer, as well as the simple and cute Japanese aesthetic. Some negative comments were made about Sega's network gaming service, with many players experiencing lag. ChuChu Rocket! was later ported to the Game Boy Advance as a launch title, where it gathered interest as the first game published by Sega for Nintendo hardware.

The player character is thrown into an enclosed world filled with sewage, with decaying wooden buildings and rusted metals.
And he discovers that his body has been changed into something in between a machine and a living creature.
He wanders around this structurally complex maze-like world in search of a way out.
""Garage: Bad Dream Adventure"" was originally released as a PC adventure game in 1999. In this game, the player character enters his inner world through a psychotherapeutic machine. He is turned into an odd-looking biological machine and searches for a way to escape from that world. Because of its unique world setting, it is described as one of the top 3 warped games or bizarre games.
It is basically a mystery-solving exploratory adventure game. But it also has many RPG elements such as character development through body modifications and intricate fishing system. And the story questions the ambiguity of escaping from the world and staying in the world.
One of the features of Garage is its detailed world building. Elements like energy circulation, ecosystem and how the world came about are intertwined tightly, and are reflected in the game system, bringing to life the feel of the deep another world. The unique feeling of strangeness and anxiety surrounding the whole game, even though it is not a horror or depressing game, is created by these settings and system.
In this mobile remastered version, almost all images have been retouched, videos have been revised using AI frame interpolation, user-interface and game balance have been improved, and new chapters, subquests and multiple endings have been added.",https://garage.t-s-k-b.com/,,"PC, iOS","Adventure, RPG, Indie","Singleplayer, 2D, Third Person, Exploration, Survival, Dark, Retro, Point & Click, Mystery, Realistic, Drama, Hand-drawn, Choose Your Own Adventure, Dating Sim, Interactive Fiction, Immersive Sim, Hidden Object, Psychedelic, Old School, collectathon","SmokymonkeyS, Tomomi Sakuba, 作場金属製作所 Sakuba Metal Works","Tomomi Sakuba, 作場金属製作所 Sakuba Metal Works",1999

No one really knows what Hitler and his generals did to bring forth this course of events, but the fall of London made it clear that the Allies had little chance of winning the war. Soon after, the destruction of Moscow and the taking of Washington D.C. ended the war.

It was hard to believe that it was the German military technique or their leaders' tactical skills. People started to talk about final development of the Wunderwaffe, especially that not many managed to flee from the battlefields to tell what they have seen - their reports were unclear and not explaining anything. Nevertheless, the world was unable to stop the Führer and his Reich.

In the year 2093, 148 years after the end of the war, the overwhelming Reich rules the Earth under totalitarianism, but Armageddon is nearing. The victory of German troops brought not only terror of Nazi dictatorship but also mysterious weather changes, which are seemingly leading the world towards destruction.

The game is based on the television series Superman: The Animated Series. Superman was released in North America on May 31, 1999 and in Europe on July 23, 1999. It is the first 3D Superman game.

Development of the game was largely hampered by constraints from DC Comics and Warner Bros., resulting in it being unfinished and of a poor quality. BlueSky Software attempted to re-do the game for the PlayStation, but due to Titus' expiration of the Warner Bros. license by the time it was completed, this version ultimately got cancelled.

In the game, Superman must rescue his friends from Lex Luthor, who has trapped them in a virtual version of Metropolis. The game is infamous for the very negative reception it received from critics and is widely considered to be one of the worst games of all time, being heavily criticized for its poor controls and graphics, technical bugs, repetitive gameplay, and difficulty.

The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The gameplay in Kanon follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Kanon has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.
Following the game's release, Kanon made several transitions into other media. Two manga series were serialized in Dengeki Daioh and Dragon Age Pure. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license was given to Funimation after ADV's closure.

It was directed, designed and co-written by Goichi Suda. A remastered version was released digitally by Grasshopper Manufacture worldwide for Microsoft Windows and OS X in 2016, while a port for the PlayStation 4 was released by NIS America in 2017; a Japanese release of the PlayStation 4 version is scheduled for March 2018 by Nippon Ichi Software. A port for the Nintendo DS was also in development, but never released due to Suda's dissatisfaction with the final product.
The setting is contemporary Japan, and takes place in a universe which would be used by Suda in later works. Within a city called the 24 Districts, a series of bizarre murders occurs, prompting the 24 Districts Police Department to send two detectives from their High-degree Murder Division to solve the case. The killings are soon linked to Kamui Uehara, a notorious serial killer who supposedly died several years before. The gameplay revolves around text-based situations, point-and-click mechanics, and interactive question and answer segments.
The Silver Case was the debut title of Grasshopper Manufacture, beginning development with the studio's formation in 1998. As they had limited staff and resources, Suda devised the window-based story-telling to make best use of their assets. The story, written by Suda, Masahi Ooka and Sako Kato revolved around themes of crime and the clashing of people on different sides: its themes would become a recurring feature in later titles developed by Suda. The character designs were done by Takashi Miyamoto, while the music was composed by Masafumi Takada.
Prior to its remaster, the game did not see a release outside Japan, despite Suda wanting a Western release: this was attributed by Suda and others to concerns over properly translating and localizing the game's dialogue and text-based puzzles. The localization was handled by Active Gaming Media in collaboration with Grasshopper Manufacture. The original version was positively reviewed in Japan, while the remaster received generally mixed opinions from journalists.

After freeing the princess of Planutus from her imprisonment by the skeleton of the count at Greveholm in the first episode, the princess has returned to her planet. But the evil jellyfish king has locked her in a cell and has taken over the planet. He has obtained Planutus' crystal ball and uses his vessel to suck up all the water on Planutus.
Ivar, Lillan, and Sprak the flying robot, the princess' faithful companions, have traveled to earth, but their spaceship has crashed in front of Greveholm castle. In order to save the princess and stop the jellyfish king, the first thing to do is to fix the rocket. In the second part, back at Planutus, the power in town has to be restored and some contraptions have to be repaired, after which the party is able to access the region where the jellyfish king lives. In the third part of the game, the player has to locate the crystal ball and bring it back to the city in order to awake the princess.

Gameplay is completely different from the first and third installment of the Mystery at Greveholm series as the game design includes RPG features. The game world is shown in a top-down perspective. The player has to control three characters, which have to eat or otherwise they fall asleep after a short episode. An energy meter shows how much energy is left. Each character has its own inventory, and the characters have different properties. For example, Ivar is able to cut down trees and to drive a vehicle, Lillan is a good swimmer and Sprak can fly into tall buildings. Except for a few mild arcade sequences, gameplay consists of locating items and using them at the right place. Sometimes only one of the characters is able to use an inventory item. Scrolls can be found that include hints.

734650,shadow-of-power,Shadow of Power,1999-01-01,,0.0,1,0,5,0,0,"Shadow of power is a fun, big freeware RPG game in the style of Zelda, combining action elements with standard console-style RPG gaming. The plot is simple, but adequate: you are Holger, a young lad who wants to become a hero. Here's the more (melo)dramatic version of the plot straight from the official description: ""On the day that Holger decided to help the crying girl and wanted to become a hero his story started. His life changed forever. There was no turning back: The man with the golden armor, the box; strange things had found a way into his life things he was not able to control. But Holger had the feeling that it was not only him who changed... The people around him seemed to be anxious. A shadow seemed to lie over his home land, a mighty shadow that dreaded to impunge everything that dared to try to stop him.""

The game looks and plays very similar to Zelda. You control Holger from an attractive semi isometric view using a simple interface: hit CTRL to attack, ALT to cast spells, and simply bump to characters to talk to them. You start out with three red hearts representing hit points, but will gain more hearts as you progress. Unlike typical RPGs, there is no complicated statistics in Shadow of Power to keep track of, and the game has a nice balance of inventory-based puzzles and physical puzzles (e.g. move the boulders in the correct order to retrieve an object). The graphics are colorful, the writing interesting, the gameworld vast, and the tasks nicely varied. A feature I really like is the F1 key, which shows the current task you have to finish. The red arrow at the edge of each screen shows the direction toward the next location you have to travel to, so you will never get lost. These user-friendly features make Shadow of Power even more accessible to beginners, and shows the care that went into creating the game. If you like Zelda, you will find Shadow of Power a wonderful console-style RPG that is well worth your time. Highly recommended!",https://www.old-games.com/download/4049/shadow-of-power,,PC,Adventure,freeware,,,1999

With its All-Star Baseball and NHL Breakaway franchises, Acclaim has wedded high-end graphics with mind-boggling menu systems. Picking up the pace with NFL Quarterback Club 2000, Acclaim has managed to produce both the finest-looking and the most daunting N64 sports game ever. Throw in an inspired feature for Monday-morning quarterbacks and you've got an impressive, albeit highly challenging, offering for the serious gamer.

To start with QBC 2000's best point: you won't get better graphics outside an actual televised football game. Period. The carefully shaped and shaded characters are the last word in realism, at least until QBC 2001. Mottled texture-maps brilliantly capture the look of both real and artificial turf.

If you're not satisfied with the 16 camera views, you can program one in just about any position you want. As if all this isn't enough, QBC 2000 gives you subtle controls over the position and size of both horizontal and vertical display.

Note that you'll need an Expansion Pak to get all this eye candy. Without one, the frame rate is abysmally slow, even in the comical low-res mode.

With the Expansion Pak installed, our only objection is that the game shows a slight slowdown on fast-moving plays. In all fairness, Madden NFL 2000 has the same problem. The player faces lack the detail of All-Star Baseball 2000, but since they're hidden behind face masks, that's not such a big deal.

Considering that QBC 2000 has more options than there are rivets on the Brooklyn Bridge, we'll give you a fly-by look. If you want to get in depth, pick up the game or, better yet, proof-read the instruction manual.

You can choose from six different weather conditions, day or night play, three difficulty levels, fatigue on/off and injuries on/off. Players you control can be identified by name, number, position or any combination thereof.

All 31 NFL teams are here, including the Tennessee Titans and the revived Cleveland Browns. General-manager options include draft, trades and salary cap. The 100 free agents include erstwhile stellar QBs Neil O'Donnell and Frank Reich. In Season and Playoff modes, QBC 2000 tracks more stats than the ESPN mainframe. Well, almost.

You can speed up the time between plays; a good thing, considering the pokey pace of your typical NFL game. You can even pick from six different celebrations for either touchdowns or sacks.",,,"Nintendo 64, Dreamcast",Sports,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer","Iguana Entertainment, Acclaim Studios Austin","Acclaim Entertainment, Acclaim Sports",1999

It was developed by the AM2 division of Sega for the Sega Naomi Multiboard arcade system board under the direction of Yu Suzuki, and was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 video game consoles under the names F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and Ferrari F355 Challenge respectively for both American and European releases. The only model of car featured in the game is the Ferrari F355 Challenge model. The game was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 possible up until that time.
Some versions of the arcade cabinet are noteworthy for having three screens, allowing the player to look through the side windows as they would in a real car. The three-screen cabinet version also features an H-shaped gear stick and three foot pedals, and presents a tough challenge to any player who decides to use them. The cabinet itself is composed of four NAOMI units: one for each of the three screens and one to sync them all. The game also allows the player to use an automatic transmission or paddle-shift the gears. It also uses a real-time ""Magic Weather"" system similar to Shenmue. The Dreamcast version has link cable play for direct competition, however as of Jan. 2006, the online servers for F355 Challenge are now offline, and the website has gone offline.
The game features an original soundtrack featuring Genki Hitomi and Minoru Niihara that mimics the style of 1980s hard rock/heavy metal which is integrated into a radio station format during gameplay (some music are later reused for the other AM2 game Shenmue). The radio DJ (and the announcer) play by the Alan J (Alan John Peppler), an American DJ who are working in the Japanese radio station Bay FM.
Yu Suzuki is a keen Ferrari enthusiast who allegedly used data from his own Ferrari 355 at certain tracks to implant in the game during its development.",,,"Dreamcast, PlayStation 2","Simulation, Racing","Singleplayer, Multiplayer","SEGA, Tose Co, CRI","SEGA, Sony Computer Entertainment, Acclaim",1999

The game was independently re-developed for the Nintendo 64 by Realtime Associates, and game designer Scott Kim. In the early days of the games production it was titled ""Charlie Blast's Challenge"". Besides changing the graphics, a four-player versus mode was also added wherein players can control Charlie or one of three other characters and must conquer as much of the land as possible with one's own bomb blasts.

54620,comic-party,Comic Party,1999-05-28,,0.0,0,0,3,0,0,"Comic Party (こみっくパーティー, Komikku Pātī), sometimes abbreviated to ComiPa, is a romantic adventure and dating sim video game by the Japanese game studio Leaf. It was first released on May 28, 1999 for the PC with adult content, but re-released with it removed for the Dreamcast, PC, and PSP. The main focus of the game is the creation of various dōjinshi by the player's character, during which there are varied opportunities to interact with a cast of girls.
Comic Party is inspired from the real world event of Comiket (Comic Market) held in Tokyo each summer and winter. This is a convention where various artists gather together to share both parody, homage, and original work. Since the series was inspired by Comiket, it comes as no surprise that the ""Comic Party"" convention also takes place in the same building as Comiket, the Tokyo Big Sight convention center near Ariake, Tokyo.
Comic Party has spawned both a manga (illustrated by Sekihiko Inui) and an anime series since its inception, as well as a Dreamcast version of the original PC game which added a new character (Subaru) and removed the pornographic elements (reverse-ported to Windows, that version is called ""Comic Party DCE""). Many artbooks, figures, and fan-made homages have been produced for it.
The anime series was licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International and the Sekihiko Inui's manga is licensed by Tokyopop. Comic Party Anthology Comic, a related manga originally published by Ohzora Publishing, is published by CPM under the title ""Comic Party: Party Time"", which is a series of doujinshi anthologies featuring stories by independent manga artists set in the Comic Party universe. Diverging frequently from Comic Party canon, this offshoot manga series includes more yaoi elements than the original materials. A more recent anime series, Comic Party Revolution, came out in 2003.
The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as Comic Party Portable on December 29, 2005. Promotional videos show that the Comic Party Revolution character designs are used, rather than the original designs from the PC and Dreamcast games and the first anime series. Characters from Comic Party are featured as partner characters Aquapazza: Aquaplus Dream Match, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus with characters from various Leaf games.",,,Dreamcast,,"Anime, Building, character, party, Parody, work, match, adult, winter, windows, girls, Manga, Yaoi",Aquaplus,,1999

Money earned in this mode is used to unlock more mini-games, artwork, music, and other items. Two players can also compete against each other in these events in a best of three competition. Players take turns completing each task until a winner is declared.

License Mode provides a series of timed tests (like knocking over poles, parking and digging sand) that must be completed in order to gain your operator's license.

The Level Editor lets players design their own courses on a 6 x 6 grid, with obstacles such as holes, electric fences, cones, and sheds. The three available shovels vary in their size, speed, capacity, and digging ability. In each event, players have the option of a first- or third-person perspective.

The individual chapters were collected and published in 18 tankobon volumes by Shueisha. The series follows the adventures of Cobra who lived an ordinary life until enemies started to hunt him down. Cobra surgically alters his face, and erases his own memory to hide from his enemies. Cobra starts to regain his memories and then unites with his old partner Lady Armaroid, and his ship Tortuga. Later in his adventures, Cobra meets the Royal sisters whose map-tattoos lead to treasure.

The Cobra manga has also spawned nine sequel series, as well as one-shots serialized in Super Jump and Monthly Comic Flapper. The manga later served as the basis for a feature-length film adaptation, for a 31-episode anime series that retells the film's story, and for two original video animations.

In 1990 Viz Media published part of the manga in the United States in twelve 48-page volumes. The full series was published in France by Dybex and later Taifu Comics, in Sweden by Epix Förlag, and in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing. The series has received mixed reviews from critics.

PLOT:
Johnson, a worker for a futuristic trade-company, got woken up on a Sunday morning by his robotic maid, Ben. Ben suggested that Johnson go to the Trip Movie Corporation (T.M. Company), a company that lets its guests experience a dream as if it were real. Johnson asked to be the king of Harlem, surrounded by beautiful women, and commanding a battlestar. In his dream, Johnson as ""Cobra"" explored space with his partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wielded the ""Psychogun"" and fought off monsters from other planets and most of all the Pirate Guild, the leader being Captain Vaiken whom he let loose. Vaiken distributed Cobra's picture to all the other pirates making him a wanted man. When the dream ended a women asked Johnson how the dream was, Johnson responding, and the woman correcting to the fact it should have been about him being the king of Harlem.

On Johnson's way back home, he crashed into a man speeding in his car. He recognized the man, who looked identical to Captain Vaiken. Johnson started explaining how he looked like Vaiken right in front of him, thus making Vaiken think he knew something about Cobra. Johnson unconsciously lifted his right arm as if he had a gun. Johnson shot a ray out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot blew up his arm, revealing the Psycho-gun. Johnson hurried back home, where Ben noticed his arm and Johnson realized that he did not remember anything from the last three years that he had lived in his house. Johnson looked into a mirror, which he turned a nob to reveal a secret room behind it, which he looked inside to see his revolver which he used in his dream. Lady Armaroid came out from hiding within Ben. Johnson started to remember more, and at that moment many people were recruited by the Pirate Guild to come in and kill Johnson. Johnson killed the recruited people and started to remember that he is Cobra and he was wanted by the Pirate Guild and he was sick of fighting them off. In order to get away from them, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armariod told Cobra that Trip Movie triggered his sub-conscious and instead brought back old memories. Once more, Lady Armaroid and Cobra set off to all the adventures that come forth.

Cobra later meets Jane Royal, one of the Royal sisters, in a bar. Jane Royal teams up with Cobra and Lady to find the other two Royal sisters, whose tattoo maps lead to the greatest treasure in the whole universe.

Space Adventure Cobra - Galaxy Nights is an interactive comic game in which the player can select what chapter to view and there is also an auto play function.

  Manufacturer's description:

In this game, the voice actors that the fans wanted most implemented much more additional dialogue in their performances. Nachi Nozawa is a regular (voice actor) onthe Cobra anime series. The game also features talented voice actors like Mami Koyama and Hitoshi Kawasaki (I'm not sure about this one). Also, Cobra's world has taken on a distinctly Playstation-esque feel. What's more, we've upgraded the CG opening, making it considerably better. We hope that the entertainment level of the game surpasses that of the comic.
