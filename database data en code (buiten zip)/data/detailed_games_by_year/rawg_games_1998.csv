Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However, the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.

One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.",https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife,https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/,"Linux, macOS, PC, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2","Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Atmospheric, Great Soundtrack, Story Rich, First-Person, Sci-fi, FPS, Funny, Difficult, Classic, Retro, Moddable, Aliens, Valve Anti-Cheat enabled, Linear, 1990's, Silent Protagonist, vr mod","Valve Software, Gearbox Software","Valve, Sierra Entertainment",1998

###Setting
The game is set in the Oddworld, a planet in another dimension, ten times larger than our Earth. Among its inhabitants, there's the race of Mudokons, a species of spiritual humanoids who can control others' minds. Many Mudokons serve as the slaves to their more technically advanced enemies, Glukons. The protagonist is Abe, a blue-skinned Mudokon who escaped slavery and freed many of his compatriots.

###Plot
The game begins right after the ending of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Abe learns that the evil Glukons use Mudokons as slaves in the Necrum Mines. The protagonist sets off on a quest to liberate the slaves. There, he discovers that Glukons' popular drink called Soulstorm Brew is brewed from the bones and tears of the enslaved Mudokons. Abe's goal is to destroy the Soulstorm Brewery and to set his people free. The ending depends on the number of Mudokons the player saved.

###Gameplay
Oddworld combines platforming with puzzles. Its levels consist of sections that occupy one screen each and require the player to overcome puzzles to move on. Abe cannot fight his enemies, but he can use his spiritual powers to defeat them, save Mudokons and advance through the levels. Abe's abilities include mind control, interacting with fellow Mudokons and limited telekinesis. To save Mudokons, Abe has to comfort them if they're angry or depressed.

The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.
Development began in 1995 at Millenium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan. The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as Windows and the Sega Saturn, Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of Halloween themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.
It was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, MediEvil 2, in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled MediEvil: Resurrection.

###Plot
During a raid on ancient tombs, Lara finds a strange artifact and meets a scientist named Mark Willard. This artifact is a part of a Polynesian cult. Willard finds a sanctuary, but four other artifacts are lost. Lara sets out to find them.

###Gameplay
The players travel through five locations. The game is somewhat not linear as after completing the first location (India), the players are free to choose one out of three environments and finish with Antarctica. Each location resembles a semi-open world with several puzzles, enemies, and platforming elements scattered across it.

The puzzles in the game require moving items, jumping over obstacles, crawling or diving underwater. 

The game features a wide variety of weapons, including the iconic dual pistols which have unlimited ammo and serve as Lara's default weapons. At some time into the game, Lara loses all her weapons and has to find her way through the enemies before finding her pistols again. 

Huge improvements were made to the game's graphics and physics in order to improve the puzzles. For example, the doors now can be triangular. The improved physics allows for modifying the environment adding quicksands, swamps or cold water (Lara can't stay in it for too long, or she will get frozen to death).",,,"PC, PlayStation","Action, Shooter, Adventure","Singleplayer, Third Person, Difficult, Classic, Female Protagonist, Action-Adventure, Third-Person Shooter, Lara Croft","Sony Interactive Entertainment, Core Design","Square Enix, Eidos Interactive, Enix",1998

Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now is the sequel to the sensational ""Game of the Year"" smash and trash blockbuster from 1997. The creators of the original Carmageddon packed the follow-up with more action, fun, and mayhem! Play chicken with an airplane! Fry pedestrians with the Electro Bastard Ray! All of the fun and none of the responsibility of motorized murder and mayhem in one huge package. What are you waiting for? Gear up and ride out!
""Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Members of the public, you have ONE minute to reach minimum safe distance!""
Crazy range of vehicles and drivers, each with their own personality and driving style.
30 grueling tracks
10 manic mission levels
10 stunning new environments

The aim is for the player to work their way up the ranking system, from 99th place to first. The player vehicle is pitted against a wide range of computer controlled competitors, in locations such as cities, desert, airport, funfair and even an aircraft carrier. Levels can be beaten in one of three ways:
Completing all the laps of the race course, as one would a normal racing game.
""Wasting"" (wrecking) all the opponents vehicles.
Killing all the pedestrians in the area.
Each level has a time limit, but more time may be gained by passing through checkpoints, collecting PowerUps, damaging/destroying the competitors' cars, and by running over pedestrians (with bonuses awarded for style).
These actions also reward the player with Credits, which can be used to make instant repairs or recover the car (after falling down a chasm, for example). They can also be used to upgrade Armour, Power and Offense stats in the Parts Shop between races. This is also the time to switch which car to drive if others have been obtained.
As well as opponents partaking in the 'race', some levels also contain a number of Cop Cars, which will activate their sirens and hound the player when provoked. They can be attacked and destroyed, but do not count as opponents. A single ""Super Squad Car"" exists in one level, and it can be claimed if destroyed.
An Action Replay with multiple camera viewpoints is available at any point during a race.
Originally released for the PC in November 1998, Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now was an instant hit and the Carmageddon series sold over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time:
“There are many clever vehicles, the levels are fun, and the physics engine is simply amazing...” - Christopher Allen Allgame.com ""Enjoyment"" 4.5 stars
“If you love the smell of gasoline in the morning, prepare to take a huge whiff of victory. This is random violence and destruction at its most beastly.” - Joe Ottoson Allgame.com ""Enjoyment"" 4.5 stars
“Arms go flying, heads pop off and roll into walls, and legs fall off and squirt blood on the ground. This game is not for the peace-loving hippie types.” - Dr.Moo GameRevolution.com B+
“The physics model is so open-ended, and there are so many silly power-ups, Carmageddon II ends up being entertaining for a long time.” - Greg Kasavin Gamespot 8.3 av. User Score
“Carma II does for Carmageddon what Doom did for Wolfenstein 3D: takes the concept and fine-tunes it, producing a game that is a ghoulish dream come true for fans of the original... and a kick in the cock for the critics.” -PC Zone 9.5
Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now is the second of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games. It was conceived and developed by Stainless Games, published by SCi and released November 30, 1998 on PC & Mac.
The Carmageddon series of games was, and remain, a poster child for video game controversy. The controversy surrounded the game's central premise; that of earning reward for running down innocent pedestrians.
The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics, and for its in-game action replay features. It was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox 3D driving game, and may have influenced other later games including the Driver and Grand Theft Auto series.
ABOUT STAINLESS GAMES
Stainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.
Stainless Games now employs around one hundred dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.

49302,robo-rumble,Robo Rumble,1998-02-23,,1.81,16,5,492,0,183913,"RoBoRumble is a real-time 3D strategy game, offering two major battle campaigns consisting of 15 missions each and a multi-player mode with hot combat for up to four players at a time. One of RoBoRumble's key features is the unique way in which Units are assembled. Unlike most games of this type, where the player is given a palette of already designed Units to choose from, in RoBoRumble the player constructs his own from a palette of different components. This gives a far greater number of variations and adds an extra strategic dimension to the game.
Each Unit (known as a ""Robo"") consists of a chassis and a weapon mounted on it. Available chassis designs range from two- or four-legged runners to jet-propelled, tracked or wheel-based craft and even tele-porters. There's also no shortage of weapons to mount on them. In addition to the standard lasers, heavy artillery and machine guns, RoBoRumble offers some imaginative creations like an ""Oiler"", that slows the enemy down by leaving slippery pools in his path, and the ""Whirlwind"", that picks up the enemy and throws him against the nearest wall. Each of the two parties in the conflict have eight different chassis and weapons to choose from. One side leans more toward ""brawn"", utilizing pure firepower, while the other tries the ""brains"" method of better weapons design. Whichever side the player chooses, only a small pool of weapons is available at the beginning. The player can increase the pool by giving out development contracts between missions.
The third optional component of a Robo is the so-called ""Booster"". This normally costs only a fraction of the other two components, but can have a huge effect on the game. Some Boosters double the Robo's speed, while others give the Robo more firepower or firing range, make him invisible, or increase his intelligence.
The relatively complex way of creating Robos stands in heavy contrast to the intentionally simple resource management. The source and at the same time, the main base, of the player's and the enemy's army is a dome-shaped, glowing ""Energy Pool"", which he must protect from attacks. The pool's capacity, which varies with each mission, is given to the player as a ""budget"" and used to create Robos. When a Robo is destroyed, his ""energy"" (the energy which was invested in creating him), flows back into the pool, so the player can build new units.
The base consists of three different energy levels. Whenever one of these levels comes under sustained fire and is destroyed, it triggers a violent explosion that, in turn, destroys all enemies in the immediate area. This ""cleansing"" effect sees to it that the defending party gains time to gather his troops and go on the counterattack.

The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch game for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console.

The game centers on the pursuit of the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge, now in the possession of a warrior known as Nightmare, who slaughters countless people to satisfy the blade's bloodlust. Other warriors pursue him either to claim the weapon for themselves or to destroy it, end his mass murder, and free him of its curse.

The debut entry in the wider Xeno franchise, it was released in Japan in February 1998, and in North America in October the same year. The gameplay of Xenogears revolves around navigating 3D environments both on-foot and using humanoid mecha dubbed ""Gears"". Combat is governed by a version of the turn-based ""Active Time Battle"" system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world in an attempt to overthrow the all-powerful rule of Deus. The story incorporates themes of Jungian psychology, Freudian thought, and religious symbolism.
Created by Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Kaori Tanaka as a proposal for Final Fantasy VII, it was allowed to be developed as its own project, first as a sequel to Chrono Trigger and then as a wholly original game with a science fiction premise. It was developed under the working title ""Project Noah"". The characters and mecha were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka, whose designs were portrayed during in-game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team's general inexperience, the second half of the game's plot was primarily told through cutscenes.
The game was nearly left unlocalized due to its religious content; its localization was handled entirely by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career. The game received critical acclaim, with praise particularly going towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and physiological and religious themes, though the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration, was generally panned. By 2003, the game had shipped over a million copies worldwide. It has since gained a cult following and is often acknowledged as one of the greatest role-playing video games of all time. While a direct sequel was never developed, Takahashi would later found the studio Monolith Soft and develop the Xenosaga trilogy as a spiritual successor.",,,PlayStation,RPG,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, RPG, Controller, exclusive, memory, square","Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square, Square Product Development Division 3",Square,1998

The year is 864 and Tiber Septim has begun his crusade to establish an empire in Tamriel, conquering all who stand in his wake. Though the Redguards of Hammerfell put up a valiant fight, they eventually crumbled to internal mutiny and the might of the Septim forces. Now under Imperial control, the Redguards are kept in line by the oppressive rule of Septim’s retainer, Amiel Richton. It is within this setting that Cyrus, a Redguard mercenary that has travelled Tamriel for over a decade, begins his adventure. Investigating the disappearance of his sister, Iszara, Cyrus is brought back to Hammerfell and thrown into the political intrigue that besets Hammerfell and its inhabitants. In his search for his sister, he must also play his part in this war between the Crowns and the Forebears.
Set 400 years prior to the events of The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Redguard contrasts with the other games in many ways. As a third-person action-adventure game, it removes its RPG gloves and instead focuses on bringing you on an immersive journey through the eyes of Cyrus. If you’ve wanted to try the Elder Scrolls series, but haven’t quite enjoyed the RPG elements such as character building and customisation, this is definitely the game for you. But, despite taking a different path, this addition still contains many of the elements that the Elder Scrolls series is renowned for: a vast world, lore-laden narrative and compelling characters. So, whether you’re a native or a newcomer to Tamriel, this swashbuckling adventure will keep you captivated to the very end.Thrilling adventure rich with lore, dialogue, backstory and atmosphere

The series is known for its party game elements, including the often-unpredictable multiplayer modes that allow play with up to four (and sometimes eight) human players.

Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel. And it cannot possibly go wrong.
In theory. Seconds into its maiden voyage it crashes into hyperspace, vanishes... and collides with your house.
Bewildered, you find your way aboard, and just as you are gazing at its awe-inspiring interior, the ship takes off again and heads deep into space. You are stranded. But you are not alone...
The ship is inhabited by a crew of malfunctioning robots and a semi-deranged parrot. You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters-Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortilian Bantoburn O'Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot.

To begin with you are a third-class passenger, and you quickly find yourself in the grip of one of the most powerful forces known to man-the desire for a free upgrade. As you move up to second and, at last, to first class, more and more of the ship becomes accessible to you, and more and more of its mysteries are revealed. What has happened here? What terrible events occurred the night before the launch? Who is the mysterious Titania whose brooding statues dominate the ship? Can you solve a series of increasingly bizarre and surreal puzzles., unlock the central mystery and return to Earth before the parrot drives you finally and irrevocably mad?

It is the third installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, which features characters from Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1998. It was ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation, which was released from 1999 through 2000. The game was re-released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as part of the Marvel vs. Capcom Origins collection.
Players select a team of characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. In contrast to the series previous entry, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom video game franchises, rather than strictly Street Fighter characters. While the gameplay is largely identical to its predecessor, Clash of Super Heroes features two distinct changes: the removal of the traditional character assist system and the introduction of the ""Variable Cross"" attack.

Due to the PlayStation's limited RAM capacity, Capcom removed tag team battles in an attempt to preserve the game's speed and graphical integrity.

The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, Europe and in North America, in 2007. To honor the 100th Virtual Console release in Europe, it became available on June 15.
It was a sequel to the original 1990 F-Zero game, and is the first F-Zero installment to have featured 3D graphics. The game has a steep learning curve and its gameplay experience is similar to that of the original F-Zero game. F-Zero X introduced a ""death race"" mode and a random track generator called the ""X Cup"". In the death race, the player's objective is to annihilate the 29 other racers as speedily as possible, while the X-Cup ""creates"" a different set of tracks each time played.
Critics generally praised F-Zero X for its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, track design, and maintaining a high framerate. However, the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail.",,,Nintendo 64,Racing,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Nintendo,Nintendo,1998

In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players in the role of a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.
Descent: FreeSpace was well received as a single-player space simulation that integrated all the desired features of its genre, from competent AI wingmen, to the presence of large capital ships that not only dwarf the fighters piloted by the player, but also explode spectacularly when destroyed. However, the game's multiplayer mode was criticised, as it was plagued by lag and inaccurate tracking of statistics. An expansion for the game, which was less well received, was also released in 1998 under the title of Silent Threat, and focuses on events after the main game's campaign with the player working for an intelligence branch of the Terrans' armed forces that later attempt to overthrow the Terran government.

Gameplay takes place in a first-person perspective in a 3D environment with the player's control limited to moving frontward and backward, turning, strafing, running, and looking behind. The game is played in short sequences or ""dreams"" lasting up to ten minutes. The player begins each dream in a random area they can begin exploring. By bumping into any object or walking through certain tunnels, the player will be transported to another setting. LSD has a set of several static and defined environments to explore including a Japanese village, a field, a city, a house, and others. While the environments are static, the default textures are sometimes swapped and they may also be populated with random objects, animals, and characters roaming about to add variety. Each dream will end after ten minutes or will end early if the player interacts with certain objects or falls off a cliff.

After each dream, one ""day"" passes in the game, and the dream the player just experienced is marked on a graph. The graph rates dreams in relation to being an ""Upper"", ""Downer"", ""Static"", or ""Dynamic"" dream. As a player plays through more and more dreams, the game adds more variety to the dreams by changing textures more often. This results in the environments becoming more surreal and psychedelic. Sometimes when starting a new dream, a surreal video is played instead of a playable dream. After 20 in-game days, a ""flashback"" option appears on the main menu which allows the player to experience an abbreviated version of the last dream they played. There is a man that wanders the dreams that, if touched by the player, prevents the player from using the flashback option after that dream.",,,PlayStation,Adventure,"Exploration, city, environment, Dreams, Animals, random",Asmik Ace Entertainment,Asmik Ace Entertainment,1998

It departs from the linear rail shooter gameplay of the Panzer Dragoon series by introducing traditional RPG elements such as random encounters, semi-turn-based battles, and free-roaming exploration. The player controls Edge, a young mercenary who rides a powerful dragon and encounters a mysterious girl from a vanished civilization.

Development began in early 1995 alongside Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996). Sega felt an RPG was critical to succeed against the PlayStation, and wanted to compete with Final Fantasy VII. The game underwent an arduous development process. Much of the challenge came from incorporating the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full 3D computer graphics and voice acting; both were unusual features in RPGs at the time, and pushed the Saturn to its technical limits. Two staff members died during development, which director Yukio Futatsugi attributed to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry.

Panzer Dragoon Saga is the most critically acclaimed Saturn game, and is often listed as one of the greatest games of all time; it earned particular praise for its story, graphics and combat. However, the game suffered from a limited release in the west as Sega had shifted focus to its Dreamcast console, and worldwide sales were poor. It has not been rereleased and English copies sell for high prices. After its release, Sega disbanded Team Andromeda; several staff members joined Sega's Smilebit studio and developed the final game in the series, Panzer Dragoon Orta (2002), for Xbox.",,,SEGA Saturn,"Action, Shooter, Adventure, RPG","exclusive, true exclusive",Andromeda,SEGA,1998

Vanguard Bandits is a support-centric strategy RPG featuring tactical combat in a medieval fantasy world in which knights and soldiers pilot mecha. This game takes place on the Continent of Eptina where numerous battles have taken place over territory, goods, and beliefs. In the midst of the conflict archaeologists in the Pharastia Kingdom discovered giant armored mecha that they called ATACs, or All Terrain Armored Combatants, that could be controlled by the thoughts of the pilot seated inside the unit's head. The Kingdom used the power of these ATACs to assume control of the entire continent, and then decided to use them to keep the peace in their new territories. Pharastia soon began to lose control as Coup d'etats and civil wars erupted which left it in a defeated state, with only their standing army remaining.",,,PlayStation,Strategy,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Controller, War, exclusive, combat, friends, console, Mythology, memory, versus",S-NEO,Working Designs,1998

The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. The player must guide Alyssa through various environments, altering between her normal and twisted personality, to uncover the secrets of her and her family's past.
Clock Tower II was met with negative reviews. Journalists heavily criticized the gameplay which they found to be poor due to its slow and dated point-and-click interface, as well its reliance on trial-and-error mechanics. The story was criticized by some but found to be mature and creepy by others. Critics ultimately did not recommend the game except to those looking for an experience similar to Clock Tower (1996) and those looking for a game that, like a cult film, is flawed conventionally but redeemed by its willingness to stray from the mainstream.",,,PlayStation,Adventure,Singleplayer,Human Entertainment,Agetec,1998

It is the third game in the Goemon series released in North America and Europe, following Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, released two years earlier. Featuring platform gameplay in 2.5D, it marked the return of the series to a side-scrolling format.
The quirky story highlights Goemon's quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man's resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and Goemon's Great Adventure continues the series' tradition of offbeat, surreal humor.
The game was received well, selling over 160,000 copies worldwide. Reminiscent of older, 16-bit games, the side-scrolling system was lauded by reviewers, who also praised the two-player cooperative mode.

A PlayStation port, developed by Runecraft, was released in 2000, under the name Evo's Space Adventures. Players control Evo, a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash, and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.
The game began development in September 1995, as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.
Upon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. It won numerous awards, including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN. Despite this, the game performed poorly commercially, and was unable to secure enough sales to warrant a sequel.",,,"PlayStation, Nintendo 64",Platformer,Singleplayer,Rockstar North,Take Two Interactive,1998

It is a spin-off title in the original Mega Man series and was originally released exclusively in Japan on April 24, 1998 for the Super Famicom. Mega Man & Bass was ported to the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld in 2002 and was localized in North America and PAL regions the following year.
After defeating the evil Dr. Wily many times, the robotic hero Mega Man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.
Mega Man & Bass debuted on the aging 16-bit Super Famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with Mega Man 8. Producer Keiji Inafune claimed Mega Man & Bass was created with regard to younger players who did not yet own one of the more advanced gaming systems. The game received positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though many found the difficulty to be too steep. Although Mega Man & Bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series, the ninth numbered title would not be released until 2008.",,,"Game Boy Advance, SNES, Wii U",Action,Singleplayer,Capcom,Capcom,1998

The game involves timing and balance by having players use their feet instead of their hands like typical video games. In March 1999, the game was released to the North American arcade audiences. It was also released to the European arcade audience under the name Dancing Stage. Players and game critics were caught off-guard by the game's addictive qualities winning the new franchise many merits to its design.
On April 10, 1999, Dance Dance Revolution was released on the Japanese PlayStation, adding new music and gameplay elements. A console release was not made for any other region. Despite the global popularity of DDR, the series remained obscure outside Japan and few official additional arcade releases of DDR were made elsewhere until the multi-regional release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006.

Following the dissolution of Midway, EA Sports picked up the rights to the Blitz name and relaunched the series on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live with a new entry in the series simply titled NFL Blitz.

Here all time eventually turns into never, while tooled-up Scavenger Operators and Ram-Runners fight for the right to courier the last of Titan’s worthless riches, dwindling resources and frozen body parts back and forth between Neo-Feudal Inter-Planetary Government Sponsored Corporations and Mutant Underworld Cartels – All of them dying to possess the last breath of Lazarus Faction Air.
Before the Optimism became (Misplaced), during the time of investment, MineCorp imported Off-World Pioneer Titan-Dollar workers to build and maintain the gigantic artificial oxygen refineries and pyramid economy serving their mining operations. Ten years ago, Titan was declared uneconomical. MineCorp shut down and returned to Earth. Work, rest play, die became trade or die.
I’m an operative and like every other wised-up sucker here, I gotta get off this ball of rock! I need money, so I’m gonna make a past I’ll want to forget. The name of the game is trade and upgrade: A bigger Moth with better software and hardware; but on Titan progress has it’s price and so do You…Here the rarest commodity of all is Loyalty. More power means more cargo means more money means more power means more enemies…Hardwar means trade up or trade in!
You’re now an Operative too, a free agent and a speculator in the claustrophobic terminally ill city of (Misplaced) Optimism, the last crater cluster on barren mined-out Titan. Scanning comms channels for salvage or sabotage jobs throughout the hostile craters and tunnel links, you aim to better your reputation, gain credit, enhance your Moth (your ship, your only real asset) and ultimately escape Titan. A fantasy for all, except the powerful and influential. You are free to do what you want within the solar-powered city, the lightwells which charge ships and power the craters are free, but hotly contested.
Expect payback for any serious criminal behavior. It’s always a question of who you know; if you scratch no-one’s back, there’s plenty willing to stab yours just for the opportunity. Your maintenance is delivery, escort and salvage. However, as your reputation grows, you’ll pick-up more lucrative work like bounty, assassination and demolition. The payoff is big-time and so are the risks, but to trade up to a Warp-Drive Moth with special F.U. model firepower, on board CPU, top comms and inter-planetary capability, you need all the Hardwar you can get!",,,PC,"Action, Simulation","Singleplayer, Steam Cloud, Open World, First-Person, Third Person, Sci-fi, FPS, Fantasy, Third-Person Shooter, Space, combat, Cyberpunk, 1990's, Flight, Old School, FMV, Vehicular Combat, Tutorial","The Software Refinery, Jordan Freeman Group","Funbox Media, Gremlin Interactive, ZOOM Platform Media",1998

Comparing the game with F-Zero X, which was released a month earlier, many critics praised the game for its individuality among the Wipeout series, offering more tracks and racing craft, unique atmosphere and ""superior track design"".

An Extraction Plant was hastily constructed to the pillage the mines and storage depots in the Kandi mountains southeast of the Stroggos capital Cerberon.

With their Makron leader dead the unorganized Strogg could offer nothing more than passing resistance. The cities and their remains closed up like hermit crabs, hoarding what little resources they had, to prepare for the day when they would again fiercely defend their ground. The earth forces had no interest in attacking these fortified cities. The enemy had retreated and now the victor was stealing its meat.

Several tense earth years passed with the two races sharing breathing space. The human base was designed for quick evacuation at the earliest sign of hostility. The plan was to take as much as we could carry before the aliens regrouped and drove us from the planet. After abandoning the Extraction Plant, the earth forces would flee back to earth with a brimming load of Steedium, closing the galactic portal behind them. But the Stroggos home world is vast. There are plenty of places to hide and lick wounds while longing for bitter retaliation.

Like a bonfire fueled by the heavens, the main Mining Facility suddenly erupts into flames, filling the inside of your cockpit with a searing light...

""Shit!"" you cry, swerving the jet off to the side to avoid collision with the huge wall of fire. As you whip your head around to make sure of what just passed by, you know the time has finally come: the Strogg are retaliating.

Life on Stroggos had been fairly quiet since the War, but you were never completely comfortable being stationed here with a colony of researchers, scientists, and military personnel, here only to harvest the planet's valuable power crystals, Steedium. Although no one expected this business endeavour to be a free ride, they certainly weren't prepared for what was in store...

A klaxon went off down below on the Colony Complex, and a voice comes across your radio headset, ""Attention all personnel: proceed to shuttle pad for emergency evacuation. Repeat, proceed to shuttle pad for emergency evacuation.""

""What's the situation down there?"" you call over the radio, making a sharp pass down toward the Complex, joined by the remains of your fighter unit.

""We're abandoning the Complex, soldier,"" Commander Kelvin replied. ""We have problems, though,"" he continued. ""The Strogg have set up a security barrier around this entire sector. Nothing is getting out. We can't penetra..atm..sphere until what... is generat... it is shut down."" Radio contact was breaking up.

""Sir,"" one of your unit fighters calls in, ""I got high energy readings at five o'clock.""

""Copy Zaero-2,"" you reply, circling the Complex. ""Follow my lead."" Elsewhere, almost secluded by the mountains lies a large Satellite dish, perched atop the rocks. It seemed odd that no one had ever noticed it before, even more so that it was there, in the middle of nowhere. Where did it come from?

""Target acquired,"" Zaero-2 announced, coming into position along the rest of the fighter unit.

""Roger Zaero-2,"" you reply, targeting the Satellite Dish on your display screen. ""On my mark...""

Down below, parallel to the Satellite Dish, a tower emerges from the rock, revealing a Strogg-manned cannon, spinning around to face the fighter jets. It soon stops, then fires up at the unit.

""Incoming! Three o'clock!"" Zaero-3 shouts. ""Evasive act.."" Zaero-3 took the hit, careening into his wingman and clipping your tail, which sends you spinning uncontrollably to the ground. The scream of tearing steel fills your ears.

""Zaero Unit,"" Commander Kelvin's voice calls out from your displaced radio headset in a pile of debris that was once your fighter jet. ""If anyone can hear this, you're our only hope.

389808,c-the-contra-adventure,C: The Contra Adventure,1998-08-31,,0.0,4,0,9,0,0,"C: The Contra Adventure (sometimes also referenced as The Contra Adventure or C - The Contra Adventure) is a 3D action game produced by Konami and developed Appaloosa Interactive that was released for the PlayStation in 1998. It was the second of two Contra games Konami of America co-produced with Appaloosa, following Contra: Legacy of War in 1996. C: The Contra Adventure was never released in Japan,[1] Europe, or Australia.

Story
A meteorite with an alien infestation heads towards Earth following the events in Contra: Legacy of War. The meteorite falls near a Mayan temple somewhere in South America, and shortly afterward, the temple is occupied by an alien life form staging an invasion, as the natives begin to disappear and the local wildlife is devastated. Tasha, a member of the elite Contra Force, is sent to infiltrate the occupied temple, but goes missing during the operation. Ray Poward (having previously retired after the events of Contra: Legacy of War), is brought back into action to re-establish contact with Tasha and neutralize the alien invaders.

Gameplay
There are a total of ten levels in the game, which are shown through multiple perspectives, depending on the level: 2-D side-scrolling (referred to as ""Classic Contra"" in the game manual), third-person (free-roaming and linear), overhead (360 degree movement), and a special ""Weightless Elevator"" view, which alternates between multi-directional and 3D shooting on a single screen. One of the third-person sequences, the ""Hunting"" level, plays almost exactly the same as the interior missions in the original Contra. All the innovations that were introduced in Contra: Legacy of War (memory card saving, hitpoints and three-dimensional fire fights) are maintained in this game. However, the gameplay varies depending on the level and perspective used. Three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal and Hard) are available at the outset of the game, though the game ends after the Pyramid 1 stage if playing on Easy.

Reception
C: The Contra Adventure received several negative reviews during its release. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave the game an overall score of 3.6/10.0, stating that ""It's hard to believe that Konami would release yet another sorry game with the Contra name on it"". Randy Nelson of IGN gave it a 1.0, saying ""Definitely not the game Contra fans have been clamoring for"".[2] Jeremy Parish and Sam Kennedy, in their Contra retrospective for 1up.com, wrote ""[C: The Contra Adventure] managed to be even worse than Legacy of War, giving [it] the distinction of being the worst game in the series"".[3]

GamePro's review of the game was more positive, stating ""although flawed, C: The Contra Adventure carries on the franchise with style, picking up bonus points for the variety of its gameplay modes"".",,,PlayStation,"Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, exclusive, true exclusive",Appaloosa Interactive,Konami,1998

In LSD, the player explores surreal environments without any objective. The player can only move and touch objects that will warp them to another setting.

The game's settings are based on a dream diary kept by Asmik Ace employee Hiroko Nishikawa for over a decade. The game was released only in Japan on October 22, 1998.
The game received a limited release exclusively in Japan alongside a soundtrack and a book composed of excerpts from the dream diary. LSD quickly fell into obscurity, but in years since has experienced a resurgence in popularity on the internet due to its eccentricity being an engaging point of discussion for humor blogs and Let's Play commentators. In retrospect, critics have praised its whimsical qualities called it one of the most ""unnerving"", ""experimental"", and ""unpredictable"" video games of all time.

Set in the year 2018, players assume the role from one of the three ESPers to overthrow Lady Garra and her Yaska syndicate from taking over Tokyo.

Developed in conjunction with Dangun Feveron (1998), ESP Ra.De. began production immediately after completion of DoDonPachi (1997). It was the first project by Junya Inoue as art director at Cave, who wanted it to be a visually attractive shoot 'em up for players taking place in a realistic setting with humans as characters. The game did not see any contemporary home ports due to rights and publishing issues with Atlus until it was re-released as ESP Ra.De. Psi for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2019 by M2.

ESP Ra.De. proved popular among Japanese arcade players and critics praised its unique power gauge mechanic, stylistic presentation, Inoue's artwork and audio design but the scoring system was found to be complex and confusing. The Psi re-release was applauded for its extra modes and character, as well as addressing issues with the original scoring system. The title spawned two spin-offs in the form of Espgaluda (2003) and Espgaluda II (2005).",,,"PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch",Shooter,,CAVE,"Atlus, Nihon System",1998

It is the sequel to The Sentinel by Geoff Crammond and features 651 levels, a multiplayer mode and a soundtrack (titled ""Earth/Air"") composed by John Carpenter and arranged by Gary McKill.
The PC version has native support limited to a software display mode and an accelerated Glide mode, because in 1998, 3DFX cards were the de facto standard for gaming 3D graphics. However, modern computers can run the game in accelerated mode with the wrappers nGlide, dgVoodoo, OpenGlide or zeckensack's Glide wrapper, which translate Glide calls respectively into Direct3D or OpenGL calls.
This game looks very different from its predecessor. While in The Sentinel the levels were bright and colorful, in Sentinel Returns they are dark and gloomy, with flashes of light being emitted when an object is created or absorbed, and the mouse pointer dynamically lighting the world. The game has a general ""hallucinated"" look: the skies are made out of contrasting streaks of color; the trees look like sperms; the boulders breathe and have a sphincter on the top; the sentinels and sentries are hybrids of flesh and metal; the sentinel stands are covered with skin and have four vertebral columns protruding from the corners; the ""specimen"" representing the living part of the synthoid resembles a hydatidiform mole, and it squirms and lets out a shriek when injected with a needle.",,,"PC, PlayStation",Puzzle,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Hookstone,"Psygnosis, SCE Studio Liverpool",1998

The gameplay is the same as in Poy Poy, though it features more powers and moves, as well as different characters and arenas. The characters use gloves, each with unique powers to aid gameplay. There are three game modes:
""PoyPoy Cup"" is a single player campaign, where the player chooses a character and progresses through tournament stages, earning gold. They can use their winnings to purchase or upgrade gloves, as well as purchase 'drinks' which give the player a temporary upgrade for an event. Upon completing the championship multiple times, the player is given the opportunity to face the boss characters. Upgrading gloves requires the player to use that glove's particular ability a set number of times. Occasionally a dark figure will appear, offering to sell a special glove to the player.
""Party Play"" is used for both Single and Multiplayer, where the up to four players (Using AI players to replace any missing slots) can set up a quick battle on whatever stage they choose.
""Team Battle"" can only be played with one or two players. The player(s) are made into a two-person team (Using a replacement AI character if only one person is playing) and compete with other AI teams to score as many points as possible. They play seven matches, and when they are finished, a cash bonus is added to the ""PoyPoy Cup"" gold count.
The players are given points for direct hits (1 point each), collecting 'lucky' gold hearts (2 points each), and their finishing position based either on when they died, or their current health. First place gets 12 points, Second place gets 6, Third place gets 4 and Fourth place gets 2.

An anime television series based on the series was later produced, titled Sentimental Journey. Three Japanese radio dramas based on the series, titled Sentimental Night, Kaettekita Sentimental Night, and Only Sentimental Night 2 were produced. A number of non-broadcast Japanese audio dramas have also been produced. Several dojin games have been made based on the characters, including the infamous Sentimental Shooting scrolling shooter, which combines a very engaging (and difficult) shoot 'em up with provocative imagery. Its nicknames amongst fans are typically Senchi or the contraction SenchiGura.
Following the 1994 hit success of Tokimeki Memorial, NEC Interchannel initiated a cooperation between Tabeta Toshio and the main staff of the Graduation series with game production house Marcus in an attempt to produce a ""Tokimeki-like"" game. While the six central characters were cast by Seiji Productions, the remaining six were considered unconventional for the time in that they were selected for public appeal. At the time, many of the staff and cast were unknown by the general public, which spurred a large media sales campaign designed to widen the game's exposure and establish it as a new brand. Advertisements and articles were placed in many magazines such as Dengeki G's Magazine as well as the TBS radio show Sentimental Night which aired in 1997. A unit entitled ""SG girls"" was formed and numerous events and concert were held. The promotion paid off, as sales of various related goods took off, the game received a positive reaction from fans, and copies became scarce.
In the Sentimental Journey anime, each episode is presented like an epilogue to the game scenario, focusing on one of the girls and telling a short romantic story. The common thread among the stories is the presence of a nondescript boy (possibly not even the same boy) who used to be a childhood crush or best friend, or just a short acquaintance, before moving away. This boy would have an influence over the girl's present life. The stories range widely from straightforward girl-gets-boy romance to friendships of various sorts and sometimes supernatural events.",,,"SEGA Saturn, PC, PlayStation","Adventure, Simulation","Story, Romance, night, girl, girls, reaction",NEC,NEC Interchannel,1998

Potato has a unique special ability to aid him: he can spin in mid-air like a certain hedgehog, and use the force to launch himself further and faster than he can run. A forward spin will launch him forward, and a backspin will launch him straight upward. This greatly aids in exploration of each stage, allowing for very long or high jumps. There are also a number of power-ups to be found, including Ice Potato and Rocket Potato.

The game is made up of a number of zones, each with six stages. At the end of each zone, Potato must face off against a food-themed boss enemy, such as a stack of plates or a giant ice cream cone.",,,"PlayStation, Xbox, PC","Action, Platformer",,,,1998

This game is the first to utilize a new system entitled Taito G-NET. An SNK-inspired system, G-NET employs the use of a small card that plugs into a newTaito-standard harness. These cards hold the entire game and are easy to replace. Game memory has been increased, and expanded game features such as a level expansion or the addition of new characters are as simple to implement as plugging in the next card. There seems to be the possibility of upgrading via a network, so no one even has to open the cabinet.

Chaos Heat plays a lot like Spikeout or Dynamite Deku. You can choose from one of three characters: Rickrider, Mitsuki and Vogt. All of the characters have attributes and abilities that make them special. They also have individual weapons: Vogt's flamethrower is powerful, but only able to be used at mid- to close range; Rickrider's energy weapon is powerful and has a better range; and the all-around best weapon is Mitsuki's machine guns, with sustaining firepower at decent range. All of the characters can pick up items throughout the game that will help you complete the adventure. The special weapons you can pick up are powerful, and some may even kill you if used in close quarters (such as the Pod and obviously the Launcher).

An intriguing story line changes depending on what character you are, who you defeat and what paths you take. The levels of the game are set up in ""divisions,"" and your success is rated on how well you complete each of those divisions.

Chaos Heat's graphic engine looks the same, if not better than Naomi's House of the Dead Side Story. This is impressive considering the significant power behind the Dreamcast derived hardware.",,,,Arcade,,Taito,Taito,1998
