Governments of the Earth have increasingly begun to receive reports of frequent UFO attacks on people and their abductions. To combat this scourge, they decide to create a service X-COM (Extraterrestrial Combat Unit ), which is designed to protect humanity from aliens. You play as the head of this service.

The game is played in two modes: strategic and tactical.

Strategic (Geoscape):
The player can manage X-COM bases and change their structure, equip planes, manage research goals: order the delivery of supplies, recruit new staff members, order the production of advanced equipment and sell alien artefacts on the black market for money.

Tactical (Battlescape):
Here the game goes into the phase of tactical combat. You have to command your soldiers, and your primary task is to win the battle against the aliens.

52884,doom-2,DOOM,1993-12-10,83.0,4.38,811,0,1637,0,1000000,"Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as ""Doomguy"", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as ""WADs"". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as ""Doom clones"". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.

The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.",https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/,"Android, Xbox One, PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation, SNES, SEGA Saturn, 3DO, Jaguar, SEGA 32X","Action, Shooter","Singleplayer, First-Person, Sci-fi, Horror, FPS, Gore, Classic, Violent, Mature, 1990's, Demons, Mars, hell, violence, automap","SEGA, id Software, Nerve Software, Infinity, Rage Software, Logicware, Williams Entertainment, Sculptured Software, David A.

###Plot
Mutt is a lost little devil. He hears a story of a Mystical Pizza that can be eaten only if you pass the Labyrinth of Chaos. The only thing is required to enter the Labyrinth - make a step through a Portal of Mortals, which a tiny demon accomplishes.

###Gameplay
The game fuses together platforming, action, and puzzle elements together and creates a unique gameplay experience. This is not an easy game, as Mutts health constantly drops (although at a low rate), the traps of the labyrinth are very well hidden and take a large portion of health if Mutt is caught into them, and the unique monsters of the game want to have Mutt for dinner. There is only one way to defeat a monster, and it is to use a specific item that can randomly spawn on the level. In any other cases, your only option is to run away.

There is no autosave system present in the game. However, it is still possible to save your progress, as there is a bedroom behind one of the doors of the labyrinth. It is also possible to find a shopkeep, who will help you with items to fight the monsters only if you have the needed sum of money. It is impossible to know what is there behind a door without opening it.

Upon entering a level, the players have to defeat an ogre that guards the entrance to the level.

It was the first Mega Man game for the 16-bit console and the first game in the Mega Man X series, a spin-off of the original Mega Man series that began on the SNES's predecessor, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Mega Man X was first released in Japan on December 17, 1993 and was released in both North America and Europe the following year. Taking place a century after the original Mega Man series, Mega Man X is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and ""Reploids"", robots capable of thinking, feeling, and growing like their human creators. Because of these complex attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, criminal activity and are thereafter referred to as ""Mavericks"". The plot of the game follows the protagonist Mega Man X, an android member of a military task force called the ""Maverick Hunters"". With the help of his partner Zero, X must thwart the plans of Sigma, a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction.
With the transition to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained that the development of Mega Man X involved reinventing Mega Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES Mega Man games that came before it, Mega Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character at the end of each stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, Mega Man X adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.
Mega Man X has met with positive reviews for its gameplay, sound, and graphics, as well as its attempt to augment the aging Mega Man franchise. A longterm commercial success on the SNES, Mega Man X has since been ported to personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices, included in the North American Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2), and released on the Virtual Console download service for the Wii, the Wii U, and the New Nintendo 3DS. The game also received a remake on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X. Nintendo re-released Mega Man X in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/MegaManX/,"Android, PC, SNES, iOS","Action, Adventure, Arcade, Platformer","Singleplayer, Story, race, environment, quick, tap","Capcom, Rozner Labs Software Group",Capcom,1993

It is the sequel to the 1991 game Seiken Densetsu, released in North America as Final Fantasy Adventure and in Europe as Mystic Quest, and it was the first Seiken Densetsu title to be marketed as part of the Mana series rather than the Final Fantasy series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying fortress.
Rather than using a turn-based battle system like contemporaneous role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles with a power bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.
The game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised the soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta and the customizable artificial intelligence (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies.
The original version was released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in September 2008, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console in June 2013 .

One or two players take control of protagonists Zeke and Julie in order to rescue the titular neighbors from monsters often seen in horror movies. Aiding them in this task are a variety of weapons and power-ups that can be used to battle the numerous enemies in each level. Various elements and aspects of horror movies are referenced in the game with some of its more violent content being censored in various territories such as Europe and Australia, where it is known only as Zombies.
While not a great commercial success, the game was well received for its graphical style, humor and deep gameplay. It spawned a sequel, Ghoul Patrol, released in 1994.",,,"SNES, Genesis","Action, Shooter, Adventure","Singleplayer, cooperative",LucasArts Entertainment,Konami,1993

(ロックマン6 史上最大の戦い!!, Rokkuman Shikkusu Shijō Saidai no Tatakai!!, ""Rockman 6: The Greatest Battle Ever!!""), is an action-video game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is the sixth installment in the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on November 5, 1993 and in North America the following March. It was included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released in 2004. Its first PAL region release was June 11, 2013 for the 3DS Virtual Console, nearly twenty years after the game's first release.
The story of Mega Man 6 opens during a competitive robot fighting tournament with entrants from all around the globe. A villainous figure known as ""Mr. X"" announces he has reprogrammed the eight powerful contestants with intent to use them for taking over the world. The game's robotic protagonist Mega Man, who was sent to oversee the tournament, springs into action to foil X's plot. A standard action-platformer, Mega Man 6 plays nearly identically to its five predecessors with a few added features such as stages with alternate pathways and new Rush adaptors.
Mega Man 6 is the first game in the series to receive character design input from fans outside Japan. This late-era game was also the last in the series released on Nintendo's 8-bit console. Due to the declining support of the NES and the growing presence of the newer and more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Capcom decided not to publish Mega Man 6 in North America. The North American version of Mega Man 6 was released by Nintendo of America instead. Critical reviews favored the game's comparable presentation and use of the established gameplay model from preceding chapters in the series, though nearly all judged it a redundant sequel.
While the first five Mega Man games are available on the Wii's Virtual Console, this game is absent from the Wii Shop Channel; however the game was released via the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan and Europe, with North America on June 20, 2013. It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on May 14, 2014, in Europe on July 24, 2014 and in North America on August 21, 2014.",,,"iOS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, NES, Android, PlayStation",Action,Singleplayer,Capcom,"Capcom, Nintendo",1993

It was originally released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in North America and Europe in November 1993 and in Japan the following month. It was later ported to the Game Gear and Master System in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The game has been re-released on a total of eleven different consoles since, with many of them being Genesis-related compilations. The game's plot revolves around series antagonist Doctor Robotnik's desire to enslave the population of planet Mobius via a machine powered by pinball-like mechanisms.
The game is set in a series of pinball machine-like environments in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog, who acts as a pinball for the majority of the game. Sonic Spinball was commissioned by Sega when it became clear that a new Sonic the Hedgehog game could not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season, as the majority of their staff were occupied with developing Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The game was hastily developed, with most of the work taking place over two months. It received mixed reviews upon release, with most critics praising the game's novelty and graphics, although its control scheme was considered a negative factor. A second pinball game, Sonic Pinball Party, was released in 2003, and a spinning rollercoaster of the same name opened in Alton Towers theme park in 2010.",,,"iOS, PC, Wii, SEGA Master System, Game Gear, Genesis, GameCube",Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer","SEGA, Sonic Team",SEGA,1993

The story follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he attempts to save an extraterrestrial body, Little Planet, from Doctor Robotnik. As a Sonic the Hedgehog series platformer, Sonic runs and jumps through several themed levels while collecting rings and defeating robots. Sonic CD is distinguished from other Sonic games by its time travel feature, a key aspect to the story and gameplay. By traveling through time, players can access different versions of stages featuring alternate layouts, music, and graphics based on the time period.
The Sega CD's flagship game, Sonic CD was conceived as an enhanced port of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but was reworked after lackluster sales of Sonic 2 in Japan. It was developed by Sonic Team—the team directed by Sonic designer Naoto Ohshima—and was designed to show off the technical capabilities of the Sega CD system. The game features the debuts of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, and includes animated cutscenes produced by Toei Animation. Two soundtracks were composed for the game: the original score was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, while the North American score was composed by members of the Sega Technical Institute.
Sonic CD is often called one of the best games in the Sonic series and the platform game genre. Reviewers praised its exceptional size and the time travel feature, which they felt added depth. The music was also praised, though some believed the game did not use the Sega CD's capabilities to its fullest. It sold over one million copies, making it the bestselling Sega CD game. The game was ported to Windows as part of the Sega PC brand in 1996, and to PlayStation 2 and GameCube as part of Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. A remastered version, developed by Christian Whitehead using the Retro Engine, was released for various platforms and mobile devices in 2011.",,,"SEGA CD, PC",,Singleplayer,Sonic Team,"SEGA, Softkey",1993

The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge) and baseball (MLB Slugfest).",,,"Game Boy, Game Gear, SNES, SEGA CD, Genesis",Sports,Up to 4 players simultaneously,"Midway Games, Iguana","Midway Games, Midway, Acclaim",1993

for the title in the toughest fighting contest of them all: King of
Fighters. Each character has a range of deadly techniques in his/her
arsenal, and players must use these lethal techniques to fight their
opponents. As in the original ART OF FIGHTING, however, using a deadly
technique lowers a character’s mental-energy gauge. For this reason,
players must use these techniques carefully. Meanwhile, players can
taunt an opponent to exhaust his/her mental energy, and even suppress
the opponent’s techniques if successful. This type of mental-energy
offense and defense gives ART OF FIGHTING 2 a uniquely enjoyable spin on
the fighting-game genre. Further adding to the strategy required to win,
an attack will become stronger or weaker depending on exactly when the
button is pressed. And even if a player is thrown, defensive action is
possible with the timely press of a button. All of this adds up to an

Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed.

As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter.

The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power.

Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession
Cordial Greetings from Count Strahd Von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia
For many travellers, I have naught but contempt and slight regard, entering Barovia as they do in timid apprehension of her wonders. They are neither prepared for life high in the Balinoks, nor ready to accept its dangers. Here, the peaks of Baratak and Ghakis stand in cloaks of granite, their cowls of snow pulled securely about them as if they alone might endure the ancient night.
However, your party intrigues me. Perhaps the harsh cut of the wind or a storm in the forest does not alarm you. If that is so, I am certain our woods, streams and caverns will attract your interest, offering many a delightful diversion. Even the otherwise abysmal village of Barovia boasts a charming cemetery. You must visit it. Perhaps, if your party survives... that is, stays long enough in this harsh and unyielding home of mine, I may require its presence. I shall ask you to join me in Ravenloft, my castle upon the precipice overlooking Barovia. It is not an invitation to be refused.
I give my leave for your party to enjoy our misty, twilight dangers. Let you challenge your wits and fighting skills; may the perilous magics of my land enchant them. But heed this warning and do not play at cross-purposes with me. To stand against Strahd is to be at odds with life itself, for he who sends these greetings is the Lord and the Law of this brutal paradise.
With Gentle Regards,
Count Strahd Von Zarovich

The desert of Har'Akir is ancient beyond belief. Not all of its past is marked by noble deeds and great kings. In ancient days, the evil pharaoh Anhktepot ruled a great and powerful nation. His downfall stemmed from his desire for immortality. Cursed by Ra, the sun god, Anhktepot's soul still remains in his mummified form and brings death to those it touches at night.
Stone Prophet, begins when your characters become trapped in a wasteland haunted by unnatural creatures, fierce sand storms, and cursed villagers afflicted by a horrible rotting disease. Your party's only hope of escape is to follow the advice of a blind seer and seek out the Stone Prophet, a huge, hieroglyphic wall hidden deep within a mysterious obelisk. Some say the writings on the wall, when deciphered, may lead the party to freedom... or to death. One thing is certain, a great conflict has been foreseen, and the mummy lord is gathering his forces.

When the series began in late 1993, it was notable for being the first to have an official licence from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The latest installments in the series contain many exclusively licensed leagues including leagues and teams from around the world, including the German Bundesliga and 2.

In addition, internationally popular clubs from around the world, including some teams from Greece and South Africa, without those nations' entire leagues. The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship and UEFA Champions League, as well as a series of football management titles.
As of FIFA 18, Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid is the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover of the series and in promotional campaigns and advertisements. Lionel Messi appeared on four straight covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16. Since the release of FIFA Mobile, Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard appears on the cover.
As of 2011, the FIFA franchise has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries. By 2010 the series had sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, and one of the best-selling video game franchises. Also, FIFA 12 holds the record for the ""fastest selling sports game ever"" with over 3.2 million games sold and over $186 million generated at retail in its first week of release.

It was one of the few fighting games of its time developed from the ground up as a home console title, rather than being released in arcades first and later ported to home systems.
Sega released Eternal Champions in hopes of capitalizing on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of Street Fighter II (1991) and Mortal Kombat (1992). The game tried to set itself apart with unique features such as a heavier emphasis on its story, characters pulled from different time periods, reflectable projectiles, force fields, fighters that carried weapons, a training mode where players had to defend themselves against robotic traps, a novel method of executing moves, and elaborate stage-specific finishing moves called ""Overkills"".
Two years later, the sequel Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (sometimes known as Eternal Champions CD or Eternal Champions 2) was released for the Sega CD. There were also two spin-offs, action/adventure games set in the Eternal Champions universe and featuring some of its characters.

*The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a courier who is shot and nearly killed in the streets of Seattle in the year 2050 by a hit squad. He wakes up in a morgue with significant amnesia as to what he was doing that resulted in his near-death—in fact, he was thought to be literally brain-burnt, which he himself felt as if he was when awakened.

*Jake builds up ""karma"" from killing enemies - on a steady basis from killing regular enemies, and in large chunks from beating bosses. This karma can then be allocated by the player into different attributes, skills, and magical powers. Physical attributes include basic factors as how many hit points Jake has. Jake also has the ability to learn new skills, such as ""negotiation"" and ""leadership,"" which allows him to haggle prices and to retain the loyalty of henchmen.

The Castle family accidentally discovered a mob killing. Fearing any witnesses, the killers gunned down the family. To avenge them and all others like them Frank becomes The Punisher. The game begins in an illegal casino and the streets of the New York City, with the merciless vigilante Frank ""the Punisher"" Castle (optionally partnered with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury) in pursuit of the Mafia enforcer Bruno Costa who ordered the killing of Castle's family; the chase ends with a fight against Chester Scully (a minor villain from the comics). Frank ""interrogates"" Scully, gets the information he needs, and then promptly shoots him. Still on track of Bruno, the Punisher infiltrates the mob's Pantaberde resort in Florida via a water duct. He breaks into a hotel and corners Bruno, who is suddenly killed by a robot called Guardroid, who tells Frank the Kingpin has programmed him to terminate him, which the Punisher must then take on.

The Punisher then raids a major drug-smuggling ring at the local harbor, which ends with him confronting Bonebreaker in a waterfront warehouse. After that, the Punisher attacks the Kingpin's poppy field at a cave in Arizona. The Punisher boards and destroys a freight train which is commanded by Bushwhacker.

At that point, the Kingpin decides that he has lost enough henchmen and money to the Punisher's actions. He puts a hefty contract out on him, and he is chased by assassins from his hideout and through a forest. After defeating another Guardroid, the Punisher in turn assaults the King Building skyscraper. He fights his way through Jigsaw and other enemies to the final showdown against the Kingpin himself. After the Kingpin is defeated, the entire tower collapses, but the Kingpin is not found among the many dead criminals in the rubble.",,,Genesis,Fighting,,"Capcom, Sculptured Software","Capcom, Marvel Entertainment",1993

Meanwhile, the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse.

A cargo pilot's plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues him from the crash and takes him to her father Kiril, who informs the pilot that his arrival via plane crash marks him as the chosen one who is prophesied to destroy Kairn. Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley, the only way he is going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That's not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers will help the hero to rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley's oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even the most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet...

Set in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe, the player directs squads of Space Marines, genetically enhanced armoured soldiers, in their missions to protect the human race from deadly aliens. Space Hulk was developed and published by Electronic Arts, with support from Games Workshop.
The game takes place aboard huge derelicts known as space hulks. Drifting in and out of the Warp—an alternate dimension used to cross interstellar distances—these vessels are infested with the four-armed Genestealers. Using overhead maps, the player orders the Marine squads, and controls individual Marines via first-person shooter interfaces. The game features a time-limited option to pause the action while enabling the player to continue issuing commands.
Space Hulk's theme of pitting slow and heavily armed Marines against fast, deadly Genestealers produced moments of frantic gameplay and a scary atmosphere for its reviewers, earning positive ratings for the game.

The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected.
Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments.
Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator.
The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and gives orders to the rest of the crew.
All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability.

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the ""kick out"" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path.

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
* Yellow = Long shot
* Red = Speed up
* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Even in Summer there is a chill to the crisp morning air as the British Task Force launches its fighters. The Argentine air force responds, and soon the air is filled with …. Spitfires and Mirages? Welcome to Dogfight, the flight combat simulator that lets you create fascinating what-if scenarios.
First published in 1993 by Microprose, Dogfight: 80 Years of Aerial Warfare was described by PC Zone Magazine as “a gift for the imagination” that “concentrates on the most important section of a flight sim, the dogfight.”
Dogfight provides three game modes that focus on pure air combat simulation.
Duel mode puts you into the cockpit in a one-one one battle right out of the gate.
In Mission mode you select from one of six theaters of war,  then choose to patrol, attack a target, support other aircraft in an attack, or defend your territory. For more modern missions you also get to select which armaments to carry into battle.
What If mode you allows you to mix and match any of the 12 aircraft with any of the missions. What to test your skills in a Spitfire against a Mirage of Syria? Have at it.
Dogfight is a classic PC flight combat simulator that provides countless hours of gameplay.
12 legendary fighter aircraft spanning 80 years of warfare
Authentic cockpits with fully functioning instruments
Third-person and first person view with realistic all-around cockpit vision
Three game modes: Duel, Mission and What If
Six accurately mapped historical scenarios
Strategic mission planning, including resource allocation, support, patrol and defence operations
Detailed manual
Aircraft include the Sopwith Camel, Fokker DRT, MkII Supermarine Spitfire, Messerschmitt Bf109E, North American F-86E, McDonnell Douglas F-4f Phantom II, British Aerospace Sea Harrier FRS: 1, Dassault Breguet Mirage IIIE, General Dynamics F-16A Flying Falcon, MiG 23 “Flogger 8”, and Mikoyen-Gurevich MiG-15.
Scenarios include WWI over Northern France, WW2 over Channel and English coast, North Korea between the Kimpo airfield and Yalu river, Vietnam over Hanoi and Haiphong, the Falkland Islands over Port Stanley, and the Six Day War over the Bekaa Valley and the Golan Heights.
The term dogfight has been applied to combat for centuries, but it wasn’t until WWI when the term was applied to aerial combat. A famous usage, and perhaps the first time the term was used to describe aerial combat, was in a London Times article describing the death of Captain Baron von Richtofen … the Red Baron.

Two different sequels were produced: Fighter's History Dynamite (ファイターズヒストリーダイナマイト, Faitāzu Hisutorī Dainamaito), known in Europe as Karnov's Revenge, for the Neo Geo in 1994, followed by Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!

The main unique feature of the Fighter's History series is its ""weak point system"". By repeatedly hitting an opponent's weak point, the player can temporarily stun them once per round, leaving the opponent open for an attack. The location of an opponent's weak spot varies with each character and is usually represented by a specific article of clothing (i.e.: a headband, a vest, a mask).",,,SNES,Fighting,"character, history, japan, fighter",Data East,Data East,1993

This high action game is an original Duke Nukem game for the Color Gameboy only! Includes Spanish, Italian, French, & German language options!

###The Game Story

As the game begins, Duke has been abducted by the Zorgonites and locked up in a prison cell on a distant planet. He's got to bust out and fight his way back to and prevent the Zorgonites from taking over the universe along the way.

No problem.

Naturally, Duke will need weaponry and vehicles... he'll have to make do with whatever's lying around. He'll also need access cards to get through certain doors. He'll find these cards by searching in the right areas. Some cards are very well hidden, so be sure to check out every corner of every area you can find!

The best way for Duke to bring down the Zorgonites is to take out their Emperor, and that won't be easy. Thousands of bloodthirsty Zorgonites have sworn to protect their Emperor at any cost. Oh, and the Emperor is on another planet. Well, minor setbacks like those never stopped Duke before, right? Anyway, once the Emperor is out of the picture, Duke can return to Earth and look forward to a life free of the alien threat. Hopefully.

The object of the game is to recover various artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, while a boss character will appear at the end of each stage, which requires the player(s) to defeat it. Like in most arcade video games, whether the player fails or beats the game, he or she will type in three letters or other text characters in to record their score.

Like Irem's previous beat 'em up arcade Undercover Cops, Ninja Baseball Bat Man features playable characters with several different fighting moves performed by inputting several commands using an 8-way joystick and two buttons (attack and jump), including ""smart bomb"" or ""screen zapper"" moves that sacrifices health in order to annihilate every enemy on the screen. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against several enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health. There are items throughout the game that include American and Japanese food for restoring health, alternate weapons such as baseballs and shurikens, or items that call cheerleaders to either obliterate enemies on screen or drop a large amount of food.

The game was released during the generation shift between the Famicom and the newer Super Famicom, and Joy Mech Fight is counted among one of the most important late Famicom games for utilizing the console's audio and visual capabilities to the fullest extent. It is also Nintendo's first attempt in the fighting game genre since Urban Champion after the success and craze of Capcom's Street Fighter II, which inspired other companies to create their own 2D fighters.

The game's objective is simply to defeat all of the enemy robots placed in each level. The concept of the 2D versus fighting game was still new during the early 1990s, and the game's mechanics are visibly influenced by several other modern fighting games at the time.

The game consists of a standard versus mode (single player or multiplayer) and a quest mode (single player). In the quest mode, there are 8 enemy robots per level (only 7 in the first level). Defeating the first 7 robots will cause the level's boss to emerge, and defeating this boss will allow the player to move on to the next level. The game is completed by advancing through all 4 levels.

The player begins the game with only one character choice (Sukapon), but every enemy robot of the first level that the player defeats becomes usable as a player character. The player can choose which character to use to combat each enemy robot. Defeating the first 7 enemies using Sukapon allows the player to choose from 8 friendly robots, but the first level can only be accessed in the very first playthrough. Screenshots of each victory are replayed after the completion of a level. Finishing all of the levels will allow the player to select a particular level that they wish to play. However, choosing some levels back-to-back may cause minor bugs in the screenshot replays. After beating normal mode, you unlock hard mode which is a harder mode. After beating hard mode unlocks special mode and all the non-boss robots. Special mode is even harder and the robots start using their hidden moves often. Beating special mode unlocks the boss robots.",,,NES,Fighting,"Multiplayer, combat, Robots, character, fight, boss, japan, fighter, versus, bugs",Nintendo,Nintendo,1993

Again you are trapped by your arch-rival - NEMESIS - far below the town you are trying to protect. You have been called upon again to perform feats of magic and courage against the worst living-dead and bio-mechanical monsters Nemesis can bring forth.

Rumor has it that Nemesis has discovered how to use the TIME GATES. He has brought back new and bizarre high-tech monsters from the distant future and decaying beasts from the ancient past. Control of these Time Gates has also given him a very insidious and twisted weapon against you. At any ' time Nemesis can teleport you back and forth through time and space itself, to challenge creatures from the very ends of eternity.

It's up to you to avoid capture or death, as you battle your way through the maze of rooms and tunnels leading toward a final showdown with Nemesis. You must traverse 16 levels of the foulest, most evil-dripping catacombs ever. There is no way out except through victory.

Along the way, you will find keys necessary to unlock doors that may lead you to a new level or lead you to your demise. There is hidden treasure at every turn. Take all you can. These treasures are needed to keep you alive and provide you with magic weapons to give you a fighting chance against overpowering odds.

You can only imagine what new sights, experiences, and threats await you as you venture from one hideous encounter to the next. Nemesis has brought together an army of vicious creatures bent on your destruction and by the grace of all that is good, you shall prevail.

The game stars Socks, the real life presidential pet of the Clinton family during Bill Clinton's tenure in office. Originally scheduled for release in the fall of 1993, Socks the Cat experienced delays until it was ultimately canceled due to the closure of publisher Kaneko's U.S. branch in the summer of 1994. The game was complete however, and review copies were still distributed to gaming publications. A prototype cartridge has entered the hands of private collectors, but the ROM image has not been released to the public. A Kickstarter campaign to fund a relaunch of the game was successfully funded and originally anticipated a July 2017 release but it was delayed until February 1, 2018.
Set in Washington D.C., Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill follows the title character as he makes his way past spies, politicians, and the news media to warn the Clinton family of a stolen nuclear missile launch device. The game makes heavy use of political satire, including bosses designed as caricatures of former U.S. presidents and other political figures.

It also introduced the ""Flip play"", ""Play-call mode"", ""Pass-catch mode"" and ""Bluff play"" options to the series. This was the first Madden title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay.
This was also the first of the Madden games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes.
Due to an error, the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed. For example, the quarterback for the Jets was #11 (Phil Simms of the Giants) while the quarterback for the Giants was #7 (Boomer Esiason of the Jets).

While similar in name, it has no relations with the Ultimate Soccer Manager series, but was followed by Striker still for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Striker '96, released for DOS, Sega Saturn and the PlayStation, and Striker Pro 2000, released for PlayStation and the Dreamcast. While never published to the SNES, Rage developed other games for the Nintendo console, including Elite Soccer, Manchester United Championship Soccer (also had version named after Eric Cantona and Lothar Matthäus) and World Soccer 94 – Road to Glory.
Focused on national teams (with a total of 64, all with fake names and individual team values), it had one of the highest option counts for 16-bit football games: up to 18 different settings can be changed, including ball weight, weather, surface, tightness of ball control, passback rule and perhaps the most remembered of all, the ability to play 6-on-6 indoor football. Several game modes are available, including friendlies, penalty shootout, Ultimate League, Ultimate Cup (group phase and knockout stage) and Knockout. However, the game lacks both passwords and battery save, and all competitions must be completed in one sitting. Up to eight players can play if two 4-player adapters are used.
Ultimate Soccer is played in a field of vision similar to the Madden NFL games in the console, a second-row view behind the players' shoulders that can also be tilted to show more field depth or more detail closer to the bottom of the screen. Player sprites, while small, are well animated and with small details such as dirt or water splashing from the players' feet (which would become one of the trademark effects in Sega's own Worldwide Soccer)",,,"SEGA Master System, Game Gear, Genesis",Sports,"Singleplayer, from 1 to 8 players",Rage Software,SEGA,1993

Each time you jump to a new sector the game will auto save (provided there are no enemies in the sector) so you can re-play should something go wrong.
Galaxy Trek lets you choose between seven levels of difficulty but the game play does not change.  The enemies will not be any stronger and your ship won’t be any weaker, so what you learn at lower levels you can continue to use at the higher levels.
Galaxy Trek was designed to let you focus on the fun, without worrying about the details. As long as your hull remains intact, everything will function. Starbases are not necessary to obtain victory, but they are needed to repair your hull, so you might want to keep one around.

The game features three-dimensional texture mapped graphics and stereo sound on supported Macintosh models. Pathways was critically acclaimed and won a host of awards; it was also Bungie's first major commercial success and enabled the two-man team of Jason Jones and Alex Seropian to move into a Chicago office and begin paying staff.

Whilst merchandise was produced alongside due to the popularity of the first of The Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry since 1945, and the original broadcast of the television series in 1984 in the United Kingdom, large numbers of manufacturers have sought to produce Thomas-branded items after the television series was broadcast in America and Japan.
The most popular and wide-ranging items of merchandise are the models of the characters, which have been produced in many different ranges, some including accompanying railway systems. The Rev. W. Awdry created the original toy model of Thomas the Tank Engine, which inspired the character, soon after the first book of stories was complete. In 1927, while still at school, he built Annie, and in 1948, he built Clarabel. Other popular products include videos, books and magazines, and computer games. 'Thomas' merchandise has also included such diverse items as: audiobooks, annuals, colouring and activity books, jigsaws, board games, stationery, clothing, cutlery, household items such as curtains, duvet covers and lampshades, and soft drinks and spaghetti shapes.
Thomas & Friends ranked number one in the preschool toys category in the U.S. and made the top 10 for the entire U.S. toy industry in 2010. In January 2011, Thomas & Friends ranked as the number-one preschool toy property in the U.K. for the 11th year in a row. Thomas is also a top-selling toy property in Australia, Germany, Japan and Korea. While the total traditional toy industry in the United States increased 1.9 per cent in 2010, overall Thomas & Friends toy sales increased over 47.1 per cent.

Set during the first Gulf War, the simulation takes place on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt where players flew sorties with the aim of defeating the Iraq armed forces and liberating Kuwait. Players had the choice of two aircraft; the F14 Tomcat, and the F18 Hornet with the former primarily focusing on escort missions and patrols and the latter bombing runs such as destroying patrol boats, bridges and SCUD missile bases.
Unlike more modern games the player was able to play the entire mission from take-off, cruise, the mission itself, return cruise and landing. Landing on the aircraft carrier required a great deal of precision and skill and was not for casual gamers, especially when flying at night. In-flight refuelling was also a feature of the game during longer missions. Again, this was extremely difficult not least owing to joysticks of the time not often being analogue.
Should a player not wish to fly a mission they could report to the sick bay but too many visits meant the player could be declared unfit and that turn would be over. However, when a pilot was declared unfit (also caused by ejecting too many times), missing in action or if they were killed, a new pilot could be added to the roster and the game resumed from where the player left off.
As well as flying the aircraft, users could command ground troops, plan missions routes and select the ordinance the aircraft should hold. There were also training missions and an option for instant action which would usually place the user in a dogfight.
The game was won when either Kuwait was liberated or Saddam Hussein was killed (tip offs were sometimes given and a player could opt to attempt a bombing run).

The manager can then send the wrestlers to participate in tournaments. The actual wrestling matches can be set in auto, with their outcome determined by the wrestlers' parameters. However, it is also possible to control them manually, choosing each move from a deck of randomly dealt cards. Moves include attacks, special attacks of various kinds, charging, healing, etc.

The muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories:
Shutting down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves.
Clearing an airfield of enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters.
Climbing from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbour.
Rescuing as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.
There are enemies on every level, from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to machine team teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes release cannon-fodder at a constant rate.
To destroy such nests or to efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a limited supply of grenades. Some dead foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.

Just like the original game the player gets to command a helicopter through a first-person perspective. Missions are preceded by a briefing and a planning stage. A map of the environment is shown from a top-down perspective with the starting position, enemy locations, fuel dumps, and the target. The player sets out custom waypoints to reach the target. Often a fuel refill is required to make it that far and it needs to be calculated in.

During missions the helicopter can be steered in any direction, but it is not necessary to keep track of waypoint directions, as they are automatically followed. The HUD contains the remaining distance, health, fuel, score, and a radar with enemies as red dots. There is a certain amount of freedom of movement and a voice warns about incoming missiles. Helicopters can be shot with a cannon. At a fuel dump the helicopter becomes vulnerable and the player can choose to disengage before the refueling is complete.

When the target is reached, an approach sequence is initiated. The game turns into a 2D 3rd-person side-scroller, unique to the series. There is freedom to move up and down and engage targets with the regular cannon or homing missiles in the air and on the ground. The helicopter can also turn 180 degrees to travel in the opposite direction. A yellow arrow marks the direction of the final target. In this sequence the player receives multiple lives (credits) to continue playing. In the first-person sequence death is final. These 2D sequences can be practiced as six scenario's in a simulator from the main menu.",,,Genesis,Action,,Probe Software,U.S. Gold,1993

It has only the first two levels. I made it in about 3.5 months, on and off, using Unity 2018.3.12f1. Mostly using this as practice, and I learned a lot.
Let me know how it is and, if you're a fellow programmer, take a look at the code to give me pointers on how to improve! Thanks. The complete project is here and the GitHub is HERE
