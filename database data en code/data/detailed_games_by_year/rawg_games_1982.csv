It is a 2D action game with puzzle elements that uses isometric graphics to create a pseudo-3D effect. The objective is to change the color of every cube in a pyramid by making the on-screen character hop on top of the cube while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Players use a joystick to control the character.
The game was conceived by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee. Lee designed the title character and original concept, which was then further developed and implemented by Davis. Q*bert was developed under the project name Cubes.
Q*bert was well received in arcades and among critics. The game was Gottlieb's most successful video game and among the most recognized brands from the golden age of arcade video games. It has been ported to numerous platforms. The success resulted in sequels and the use of the character's likeness in merchandising, such as appearances on lunch boxes, toys, and an animated television show. The character Q*bert became known for his ""swearing"", an incoherent phrase of synthesized speech generated by the sound chip and a speech balloon of nonsensical characters that appear when he collides with an enemy.
Because the game was developed during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to Q*bert remained with Columbia even after they divested themselves of Gottlieb's assets in 1984. Therefore, the rights have been owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment since its parent Sony acquired Columbia in 1989.

It is based on the film of the same name, and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw. The objective of the game is to guide the eponymous character through various screens in a cubic world to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.
Warshaw intended the game to be an innovative adaptation of the film, and Atari thought it would achieve high sales figures based on its connection with the film, which was extremely popular throughout the world. Negotiations to secure the rights to make the game ended in late July 1982, giving Warshaw only 5 and a half weeks to develop the game in time for the 1982 Christmas season. The final release was critically panned, with nearly every aspect of the game facing heavy criticism. E.T. is often cited as one of the worst video games of all time and one of the biggest commercial failures in video game history. It is considered to be one of the most significant titles in the history of video games, as it is cited as a major contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983, and has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture in the years since its release, often being used as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference.
Reports from 1983 gave way to urban legend stating that as a result of overproduction and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles.

The games of the Swordquest series (along with Atari 2600 Raiders of the Lost Ark) were some of the earliest attempts to combine the narrative and logic elements of the adventure game genre with the twitch gameplay of the action genre, making them some of the very first 'action-adventure' games. However, the series was unable to hold the last two contests along with the grand finale contest, as well as release the final game in the series, due to Atari's financial problems leading up to and being a part of the video game crash of 1983.",,,Atari 2600,Adventure,Singleplayer,Atari,Atari,1982

Ihor Wolosenko, co-founder of Synapse, noted that it was Shamus that really put the company on the map by giving it a reputation for quality. It was followed by a sequel, Shamus: Case II, with the same characters but different gameplay.
Mataga's original version was 16K in size and released on disk and tape for the Atari 8-bit family, and later sold by Atari on cartridge following the launch of the Atari XEGS in 1987. The VIC-20 port was 8K and contained only 32 levels (unlike the 128 in every other version). In 1999, Mataga developed a remake for the Game Boy Color, and later, both Shamus and Shamus: Case II for iOS.

This is an educational game teaching spelling. The tuition is through spoken commands and dictated words for the player to spell. The player spells the words by typing on the keyboard and they are simultaneously displayed on the screen. The spoken commands and words are delivered in American English, through the computer audio output. Ten lists of words are provided for spelling, in graduated difficulty. You can also make custom lists. A list is selected at the start of each game.
It features a multilevel cave which the player's joystick guided character (selection of boy or girl) explores with the objective of finding a number of crystals in order to exit the dungeon. The character uses a flashlight to illuminate his/her way around the dungeon to find the crystals, which are attached to the dungeon wall in random locations.
The cave features a number of obstacles: crevasses to fall or jump down a level, rocks to trip over, puddles to slip and fall in, and scorpions and snakes to sting you. Your character can jump over these using a joystick button. If you fall or get stung, you have to use one of the 5 bandaids you started with. There are ladders to go up and down levels safely.
At intervals, the ""Word Wizard"" appears and commands you to spell a word. If you type the word correctly, you get rewarded with a new bandaid, and a congratulatory ""well done!"" or similar encouragement. If you wait too long or spell it wrongly, you get admonished, ""You need work on that one!"" or ""It's getting darker!""
