Player 1 is the Pursued, represented by a plus sign, and player 2 is the Pursuer, represented by a square. The Pursuer's goal is to catch the Pursued, while the Pursued's goal is to stay away until time runs out. The closer the Pursuer is to the Pursued, the faster the frequency of the electronic beeping in the background. The maze walls shift, potentially blocking paths and creating new ones.",,,PC,"Action, Casual, Indie","Multiplayer, Co-op, cooperative, Partial Controller Support, Funny, Local Co-Op, Shared/Split Screen Co-op",Atari,"Atari, KIDOM",1973
