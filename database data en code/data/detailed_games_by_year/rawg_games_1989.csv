In the game, players control an unnamed protagonist who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the Grand Vizier Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess.

Much like Karateka, Mechner's first game, Prince of Persia used rotoscoping for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference for the characters' movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white clothes and swashbuckler films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood.

The game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success, sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and inspired many following games in this subgenre, such as Another World.[4] Its success led to the release of two sequels, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame and Prince of Persia 3D, and two reboots of the series, first in 2003 with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, which led to three sequels of its own, and then again in 2008 with the identically-titled Prince of Persia.",http://www.jordanmechner.com/projects/prince-of-persia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/,"Genesis, Commodore / Amiga, SEGA CD, SNES, Game Gear, SEGA Master System, Classic Macintosh, NES, Nintendo 3DS, iOS, PC, Apple II, macOS, Wii, Game Boy, Atari ST, Game Boy Color","Action, Adventure, Platformer","Singleplayer, Cinematic, Puzzle-Platformer","Broderbund Software, Brøderbund, MotiveTime, Arsys Software, Riverhillsoft, Domark, Ports","Ubisoft Entertainment, Konami, Virgin Interactive, Broderbund Software, Brøderbund, Riverhillsoft, Ports",1989

The first game in the series, SimCity, was published by Maxis in 1989. The success of SimCity sparked the creation of several sequels and many other spin-off ""Sim"" titles, including 2000's The Sims, which itself became a best-selling computer game and franchise.
In the SimCity games, the player develops a city from a patch of undeveloped land. The player controls where to place development zones, infrastructure like roads and power plants, landmarks, and public services such as schools, parks, hospitals and fire stations. The player also determines the tax rate, the budget, and social policy. The city is populated by ""Sims"", simulated persons, who live in the city created by the player. The three development zone types are the major areas in which Sims inhabit: residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones where Sims find work in factories, laboratories and farms.
While there is no particular win condition in a game of SimCity, the balancing act of the above mentioned factors provide the constraints which make gameplay possible. To maximize population or profitability, to re-create real life locations in-game, achieve an aesthetic design or to trigger as many natural disasters as possible are among the many possible goals one can determine for oneself while playing a SimCity game.

It is known for its pioneering hardware and graphics, nonlinear gameplay, and a selectable soundtrack with music composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi. The goal is to avoid traffic and reach one of five destinations.

The game was designed by Yu Suzuki, who traveled to Europe to gain inspiration for the game's stages. Suzuki had a small team and only ten months to program the game, leaving him to do most of the work himself. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling video games of its time and Sega's most successful arcade cabinet of the 1980s. It was ported to numerous video game consoles and home computers and spawned a number of sequels. Out Run has been cited as an influence upon later video games.",,,"PC, SEGA Master System, Nintendo 3DS, Atari ST, Genesis, Game Gear","Action, Adventure, Simulation, Racing, Arcade, Indie","Singleplayer, First-Person, Horror, Exploration, Female Protagonist, Action-Adventure, Dark, Survival Horror, Mystery, Realistic, Multiple Endings, Demons, Протагонистка, Psychological, Family Sharing","Unlimited Software, DeanTheDev","SEGA, DeanTheDev",1989

Bold, colorful and often brutal, these tales survived the ages. They were a tribute to the legendary High King of Britain who managed to bring the warring tribes of Saxons, Celts, Angles Jutes under one rule and bring about a rebirth of Western civilisation.
Sadly, in the last half century, the Arthur legend has been recast as a cartoon and children's story. The mystic rituals and dark passions that colored the original  Arthurian legends have been watered down to the soft and toothless fairy tales most commonly seen today.
With Conquest of Camelot, designer Christy Marx has dug deep into the most ancient roots of legend to restore the power and passion of King Arthur and his court: his queen's forbidden love for Sir Launcelot; the struggle for supremacy between Christianity and the ancient Roman warrior-god Mithra. The blending of myth, history and religion behind the Gail legend is dealt with honestly and directly.

It was the first Shinobi game developed for the Sega Genesis, and was later released on the coin-operated version of that console, the Mega-Tech.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling platform game. The player controls Joe Musashi and must complete eight districts before the final confrontation with the head of Neo Zeed. Each district consists of three scenes, two of which are platforming levels and the third being a battle against a unique boss-character.

The directional pad moves Joe around while the A, B, and C buttons are used to perform ninjitsu techniques, attack, and jump respectively. A key move in The Revenge of Shinobi is the somersault, which maximizes Joe's jumping height and enables him to throw eight shuriken at once in mid-air. Additionally, some stages consist of multiple layers, such as the first scene of the Military Base and the freeway in Area Code 818. Switching between layer (outdoor/indoor, or on-the-highway/next-to-it) is also done with the somersault move.

Although his standard ability of moves and attacks, Joe has the ability to do four special ninjutsu techniques. Only one can be performed in each level, unless a ninjitsu item was picked up, or the ninjutsu of Mijin was used.

A variety of bonus crates can be found in each level, some hidden in the scenery. These include simple powerups such as extra shuriken or health packs, as well as special items to gain lives or extra ninjutsu attacks. Besides powerups, some crates may contain time bombs: explosives that detonate when their fuse runs out or if Joe comes too close (though he can walk out of the blast radius if the player is quick enough).

The game is divided into four difficulties. As difficulty increases, more enemies appear per stage; on Hardest, Musashi takes twice as much damage and the amount of starting lives decreases from 10 to 1. From the options menu, the player can also choose the amount of starting shuriken from 0 to 90 (though a technique does exist that allows infinite shuriken).",,,"PC, Genesis",Platformer,"Retro, Ninja, platformers",SEGA,SEGA,1989

Interesting People. Sorcerer University is famous for its friendly and robust student body (quite a few of them, actually) eager to help freshmen find their way around and get most out of those late night cramming sessions.
Field Trips. Visit the most fascinating places in Peloria, from the Island of Horny Women to the Island Where Time Runs Backwards to the Restaurant at the End of the Ocean. No, you can't skip right to the Island of Horny Women.
Intellectual Challenge. Learn the art of sorcery from the masters themselves. Refine your skills in the Simulation Lab, where you'll challenge a ferocious dragon and rescue an imprisoned damsel. Of course, which skills you choose to refine is entirely up to you.
Adventure. You've got a mission to accomplish, and it's not some cheapo Find-The-Missing-Magic Sword quest, either. We're talking END OF THE WORLD type-stuff here - and if you blow it, you can forget that frat party next week.
Sorcerers Get All The Girls can be played in either ""naughty"" or ""nice"" mode. With its obvious satirical content, the game is intended for the amusement of adults, or at least those old enough to see an R-rated movie (or sneak into one). It contains language and a general moral attitude that may offend some. It is recommended that these people buy the game, and then hide it from their shelf as a form of protest.
Award-winning game designer Steve Meretzky's latest graphic adventure contains the same wicked sense of humor, devilish puzzles and bawdy satire found in his other works, notably The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,Leather Goddesses of Phobos, Planetfall and Zork Zero.
Steve profoundly apologizes and promises never to do it again. Honest.
More babes. More brewskis. More bad jokes.
A flash of light... a puff of smoke, and... EUREKA! the perfect woman steps out of The Sorcerer's Appliance. You've just created Eve! (It's only been done once before, and that time it cost the guy a rib).
Return to Animal House. It's pledge week at Sorcerer University, and with Eve's magical help, you'll survive a series of ridiculously impossible hazing tasks. But life isn't all dancing bananas, shower rooms and melodious moodhorns; and soon you find yourself in a desperate race to save the University from certain destruction.
A Tale of High Education and Low Morals. Ernie Eaglebeak is once again the unlikely hero in this hilarious romp through the bedrooms, turrets and tunnels of Sorcerer University and nearby Barmaid U (where grading on a curve takes on a whole different meaning). To pass this course, you'll need to cast ridiculous spells, solve ribald puzzles and ""interact"" with gorgeous women. Any questions? We didn't think so.
Class dismissed.
From the scandalous imagination of Steve Meretzky, Spellcasting 201 is a sequel to his award-winning hit game, Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All The Girls. Although this game may be played in either ""naughty"" or ""nice"" mode, it may be considered unsuitable for young minds, as it contains material and situations that children have already seen in far greater detail on daytime television..
Follow the sun and the scent of coconut oil straight to Fort Naughtytail where Ernie Eaglebeak parties hardy with his fraternity pals in this high energy seaside romp. Ernie is hoping to find sand in all the wrong places, but ends up battling a rival fraternity from back home in a series of zany beach contests complete with gorgeous babes, wet T-shirts, mud wrestling and body surfing.
Ernie must use his wits and a healthy dose of magic to save the honor of his fraternity. There's a lot to do, and the Ft. Naughtytail Police Dept. is desperately trying to keep everyone from doing it!",,,"PC, Linux, macOS",,"Magic, Destruction, puzzles, Education, party, island, race, fun, night, challenge, art, Movie, humor, sword, light, student, quest, wizard, girls, animal",Legend Entertainment,Piko Interactive,1989

trapping them in bubbles and then popping them. Although the
puzzle-action game can be beaten by clearing all 100 rounds, it also
contains secret elements such as not being able to get the ""true ending""
in single-player mode; hidden commands that lead to secret rounds; and a
ton of different items. These elements are some of the game's most
memorable and important features. Each round even has different air
currents that are not visible, so bubbles rise in unpredictable

different patterns while playing help make this a revolutionary game

You four - a warrior, a magician, a priest and a paladin - you tiny band of four must somehow vanquish the evil Uukrul. For he and his depraved followers hold the once-lovely city of Eriosthé in dark dominion. And until he is destroyed, the entire land lies helplessly at his mercy.
More than merely vicious, Uukrul is literally heartless. To free his body from the material plane, he has actually detached his soul - and hidden his heart deep in the mountain city's maze-like passages. But where is his heart, and how is it protected? What are the heart-shaped keys that lie hidden in the far reaches of Eriosthé?
And how can you defeat him when you at last capture his dark heart?

In your quest, you'll be armed with magic, prayers, spells and weapons... but you'll need courage and quick wits as well. For you'll be challenged at every step of the way by baffling puzzles and packs of savage monsters... until finally you must face Uukrul himself!

As longtime aficionados of both visual novels and romcom anime we've spent the past few years pouring our heart and soul into Pipe Dream, a slice-of-life dating sim that follows Robin as she explores college life and escapes her mother's shadow. Unlike many other dating sims we wanted to create a game that doesn't just end when the characters get together, but also explores the complexities of how the relationship develops afterwards.
We have a cast of six charming characters for the player to romance, but be careful! Not everyone has Robin's best interests at heart.
Gary (CV. Lucas Gilbertson) ーA happy-go-lucky guy with no personal space bubble. Studying to be a forensic scientist. Intelligent, emotional, and occasionally overwhelming.
Elliot (CV. Brett Bauer) ーA quiet, grumpy guy studying to be a vet. Wants to be cool, but his streak of bad luck and lack of chill always end up sabotaging him.
Avalon (CV. Carol Anne Day) ーRobin's best friend since high school and current roomie. Energetic, independent, and meddlesome. A ride or die friend.
Akio (CV. Belsheber Rusape) ーA naive, arrogant rich kid who cut ties with his family to pursue his passion for art. Huffy, dramatic, and hates being incapable.
Cain (CV. Tom Aglio) ーA perpetually tired charmer juggling part-time jobs to provide for his younger sibling, his only present family. Slowly chipping away at his business degree.
John (CV. Griffin Puatu) ーA sporty, well-liked guy that somehow slips everyone's mind. Too nice for his own good, but has trouble opening up to people. Loves to read.
And last but not least, the protagonist herself:
Robin (CV. Melissa Dorsey) ーA down-to-earth and quietly sarcastic girl who used to be a goody-two-shoes. Was salutatorian in high school. Cut ties with her mother and ran away to college to discover what she wants from life.

The original version was programmed by Dino Dini with graphics, playtesting and tuning by Steve Screech. first released in 1989, Kick Off was received well by the games industry at the time and won awards.
After the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of Kick Off). Kick Off 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to Kick Off. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.
In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with Kick Off and Kick Off 2. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the Kick Off and Player Manager series. Kick Off 2002 was released.

The goal of this game is to track Carmen's villains through history and arrest them and ultimately arrest Carmen herself.
Similar to World, the player plays as a secret agent for the Acme Detective Agency, and has to use the research books to crack the clues given to them on where the crook went to, and also decode the physical attributes or interests of the crook based on other clues. They must achieve both these objectives in order to secure an arrest warrant, which allows them to identify the person at the end of the case as the crook. The player travels through time and space with a device known within the Carmen Sandiego universe as the Chronoskimmer. The game is time limited, and every action one takes uses up some of that time; the player needs to solve the case within the allotted time in order to be successful. As well as teaching the player about both geography and history it also provides practice with using a research book – the New American Desk Encyclopedia comes with the game for assistance. The people, events, and inventions featured in the game hail from period in history ranging from 400 AD to the 1950s – the past 1500 years of human history. The game comes with a 28-page instruction manual.
This was the first game in the series to establish that ACME Headquarters is located in San Francisco.
The game was released on a variety of different platforms including Apple II (1989), Amiga (1990), Commodore 64/128 (1990), Macintosh (1990), IBM PC Compatible (1990), Nintendo Entertainment System (1991), Sega Genesis (1992), and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1993).
In 1991, Konami released a port of the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System which included a small, paperback encyclopedia as a free pack-in. Hi Tech Expressions later created a port for the Super NES. Electronic Arts also created a port for the Sega Genesis.

The citizens of New York believing as time passed that they had been victims of a colossal hoax.

The Ghostbusters team now earn their living hiring themselves at parties, running occult bookshops and appearing on seedy occult TV programmes.

It's winter time and the New Year is just around the corner. Dana Barrett has returned to live in the city with her baby son Oscar. The city seems even more paranoid than she remembers it. She is returning from the store laden with groceries when the buggy Oscar is travelling in begins to jolt forward. The brakes unlock themselves. She reaches towards the handlebars, but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement she reaches for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls even further away. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but everytime someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked.

It comes to a dead stop in the middle of the street, a bus narrowly missing it by inches. Cars and trucks swerve and hit the brakes as Dana runs to the intersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs him close, deeply relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural hasre-entered her life.

DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up game partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities. What made the game unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters rode around on roller skates rather than walking or running.
The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as ""Rollergame"", taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs.
DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the ""prizes"" consist of coins that are dropped by defeated enemies, or food items like burgers that restore health.",,,Genesis,,"Singleplayer, 2 players",Kaneko,"Sammy, Kaneko",1989

The game introduced innovations in presentation. It was the first NBA game to feature TV style starting line up prior to the opening tip. It also featured halftime shows and announcers to simulate an authentic feel. Later games would go further by replacing music during gameplay with audience cheers. The game was conceived by Producer Don Traeger, and principal work done by programmer Robert Weatherby and Art Director Michael Kosaka.

It was released in an updated form for Microsoft Windows in 2005 by Superior Interactive.
The object of the game is to retrieve five hourglasses from diverse scenarios to restore the flow of time. It features elements of both platform and puzzle games. The puzzles are mostly logical (keys unlock doors, gold placates a burglar), though there are exceptions.
While the game shares many elements made popular in earlier Superior arcade adventures such as Citadel, it has a unique feel due to the movement of the main character. The player controls a creature named ""SPRAT"" (Small Partially Robotic Alien Time-traveller), depicted as a red sphere wearing sunglasses. SPRAT moves by rolling but can only do so along level ground or down slopes. There are ladders to climb but many platforms require a special movement to be reached. By holding 'down' (SPRAT squashes himself) to build up potential energy, then releasing, SPRAT can bounce at either a 45 or 90 degree angle.

The player can earn fame points by occupying cities and airports and destroying units of the opponent's army; fame points are lost by losing units of one's army in battle or retreating from battles. The goal of each of the 16 scenarios is to destroy the enemy's flag tank. The first player controls the blue (Western Bloc) forces while the computer (or second player) controls red (Eastern Bloc) troops.
Each player starts with two or three factories, at least one of which specializes in air combat units and at least one of which specializes in ground warfare units. On each turn, the player can, if he still has a factory that has not been destroyed, produce one military unit. The more fame points the player has, the more powerful units he can produce (e.g. tanks instead of infantry). The computer always starts with more fame points than the human; since this state of affairs tends to produce an increasingly overwhelming materiel advantage if left unaddressed, the goal of depleting the computer's fame points, usually by destroying powerful red Army units, tends to be a high priority at the beginning of the game.
The hexagons can be plains, woods, mountains, barren terrain, shoals, seas, bridges, airports, towns, or factories. The terrain in each hexagon has an effect on maneuverability and the extent to which forces can take evasive action. Units can be repaired, refueled, and rearmed at cities or airports, depending on whether the unit is a ground or air unit.

The game was ported by Arsys Software to the NEC PC-98 and Sharp X68000 computer platforms in 1989, and then ported by Masaya (NCS) to the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) home console in 1990.
The game is considered innovative and ahead of its time, for being an early example of an action role-playing game with fully 3D polygon graphics, combined with early first-person shooter gameplay, which would occasionally switch to space flight simulator gameplay when exploring the open-ended outer space with six degrees of freedom. All the backgrounds, objects and opponents in the game were rendered in 3D polygons, many years before they were widely adopted by the video game industry. The game also emphasized storytelling, with plot twists and extensive character dialogues, taking place in a futuristic science fiction setting.
Namco licensed the Mega Drive version of Star Cruiser for a North American release entitled Star Quest, which Namco planned to publish for the Sega Genesis in July 1994. However, the North American release of Star Quest was eventually canceled.

Lead a team of 13 condemned creatures to victory by any means necessary. Pick a fight, buy or sell players on the market – or bribe the opposing team, the referee or the fish serving as the ball!
Win the game by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals – or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackle, pummel or throw players into the moat… but if you get thrown in yourself, get out before the shark-like monster eats you!
As a manager, you’ll control the team funds – by booking hotels in the cities you visit, paying for drinks and using bribes to your advantage.
As a coach, you’ll train your team of misfits to use tactics and fighting moves and throw the other team on their backs.
As a player, you’ll run, foul, jump, tackle, bite, kick, cheat and do whatever it takes to fight your way through every match.

The player controls a humanoid character that fights monsters and must juggle between items in order to survive. The box credits Nolan Bushnell for the game and includes his photo on both the front and back. According to Secret Quest programmer Steve DeFrisco, ""Atari thought that his name would entice people to buy some more 2600 titles"".

The game was inspired by Nintendo's The Legend Of Zelda (1987) for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with the space-themed concept developed and programmed by Steve DeFrisco. Chris DeFrisco was hired to complete the artwork. The development team faced data-size issues when trying to fit the game onto the cartridge ROM.

Even the store description below is the very same language used to describe the title at the time of its release. Please enjoy!
You're the only human in a huge, robotic space ship, flying at incredible speeds through deep space. Your mission: find and settle a new planet where humanity can thrive. Combat is inevitable, but you'll need more than flying skills to succeed. You'll also need resourcefulness, charm and political skill to help you negotiate with the bizarre, intelligent - sometimes hostile - beings who correctly see you as the alien.
3D Combat Flight Simulation Like You've Never Seen
Earth-bound simulations spend most of their graphic power on landmarks and other terrain. But since there's no terrain in the black void of out space, Lightspeed devotes its Super 3D Graphics power to showing space ships in breathtaking detail and animating them with unprecedented smoothness.
- Pilot a starship 15,000 feet long
- Customize your ship for the performance you need
- Control remote fightercraft in strategic battles with intelligent enemies
Fascinating Role-Playing Depth
Multiple star clusters await your exploration, each with unique challenges. A dozen solar systems spin through each cluster; scores of planets revolve around each sun. Most important, 25 species of aliens require your constant attention.

- The Lutin - quasi-intelligent, with no memory and no concept of the future
