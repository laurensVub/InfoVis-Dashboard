You can either create your protagonist or play as three pre-set options - Albert Cole, Max Stone or Natalia Dubrovhsky. When in Vault 13 water supplies start to malfunction via technical reasons, Overseer sends protagonist in a quest to find a replacement and save the Vault. Having Pip-Boy and some standard equipment, the Fallout world is absolutely open for exploration. 

Although being a completely different genre of the game, Fallout still uses the same systems as we know today. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of characters stats (strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck) affect your skills in a variety from 0% to 200%, as well as definitive straits that you choose only once for whole gameplay.

Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers’ mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies.

It is best known and somewhat infamous for its uncanny violence, cynical black humor, and a highly controversial theme. The game offers the player to ""go postal"" on a spree shooting across the city.

###Plot
The player controls the protagonist, nicknamed The Postal Dude: a homeless middle-aged man who apparently goes crazy and hears disembodied voices. He believes in a conspiracy theory that US government has poisoned his hometown with a nerve agent, and he's the only sane person around. He tries to eliminate the crowd he considers ""infected"". His goal is to fight his way to the US Air Force base which he believes is responsible for the presumed attack.

###Gameplay
Unlike its better-known sequel, POSTAL is 2D and uses top-down and isometric views. On each level, the player has to kill a specified share of enemies: civilians, military, and police alike. When this goal is complete, the door to the next level will appear. The player can complete the level even if The Postal Dude is killed, as long as the number of his own kills is satisfactory. The character can carry up to 8 types of weapons with varying strength and ammo limit. His basic gun is the weakest but has indefinite ammo supply.

###Plot
In the distant future, an alien race of Stroggs attack human colonies. As a result, humanity develops operation Overlord as a countermeasure and launches a counter-attack at the Strogg homeworld called Stroggos. The main objective of the soldiers is to close down the portal, which is used by Stroggs to teleport their armies on Earth. The operation does not go as smooth as planned and Bitterman, the main protagonist, is the sole survivor of his squad. He must finish the mission.

###Gameplay
Quake II is an iconic first-person shooter. There are no health regeneration or weapon reloading systems present in the game. Instead, the players have to pick up health kits, ammo packs, and scavenge ammo from the dead Stroggs. 

As the game progresses, more strong Stroggs appear, their numbers rise, and these aliens become much more accurate. More types of Stroggs also appear, such as the medics, that can revive their fallen comrades.

The game features 36 levels with the addition of three secret ones. Secrets are hidden on all levels, which contain useful items within them, such as a Quad Damage special boost.

###Location and plot
The game takes place in 3 different cities, each one resembling real-life counterparts such as Miami, New York City and San Francisco. The world of the game is only restricted by traveling from one city to another, while the cities themselves are free to explore. The plot is expressed in the form of various missions, where the playable character receives general instructions through a phone call, or otherwise. 

###Gameplay
Each mission in the game has a set goal of in-game points, awarded for successful completion of mission’s requirements, and sometimes causing mayhem for the sake of it. Completion of these missions allows the player to move on to more difficult tasks, and eventually, another chapter in other cities. The player often has to steal vehicles, sell them for profit, perform roadkills and escape the police, as the number of attempts for each mission is limited.

###Graphics and reception
The game features a simplistic style for graphics, sacrificing different animations and sprites in favor of just being fun to play. At the time of release, in late 1997-1998, Grand Theft Auto offered unique arcade gameplay with an open world, where players could do anything they wanted, which, of course, was the key to overwhelming success of the game.",,,"Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Game Boy, PC",Action,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Open World, 2D, Classic, Top-Down","DMA Design, Visual Sciences, Tarantula Studios","Take Two Interactive, BMG Interactive, ASC Games",1997

The game features a largely new cast of characters, including the debut of several now-staple characters such as Jin Kazama, Ling Xiaoyu, Julia Chang and Hwoarang, with a total of twenty-three characters. The home version included a new beat'em up mode called Tekken Force, as well as the bonus Tekken Ball mode.
Tekken 3 is considered one of the greatest games of all time. With more than 8.5 million copies sold worldwide, Tekken 3 is the second best selling fighting game of all time and the fourth best-selling PlayStation game. A non-canonical sequel was released in 1999 and 2000 in arcades and on the PlayStation 2 respectively, titled Tekken Tag Tournament. It was followed by the canonical sequel Tekken 4 in arcades and on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and 2002, respectively.",,,PlayStation,Fighting,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive",NAMCO,"Namco, SCEE, Namco Hometek",1997

The aim is for the player to work their way up the ranking system, from 99th place to first. The player vehicle is pitted against a number of computer controlled competitors, in locations such as cities, mines and desert towns. Levels can be beaten in one of three ways:
Completing all the laps of the race course, as one would a normal racing game.
""Wasting"" (wrecking) all the opponents vehicles.
Killing all the pedestrians in the area.
Each level has a time limit, but more time may be gained by passing through checkpoints, collecting powerups, damaging/destroying the competitors' cars, and by running over pedestrians (with bonuses awarded for style).
These actions also reward the player with Credits, which can be used to make instant repairs or recover the car (after falling down a chasm, for example). They can also be used to upgrade Armour, Power and Offense stats in the Parts Shop between races. This is also the time to switch which car to drive if others have been obtained.
As well as opponents partaking in the 'race', some levels also contain a number of heavily armored Cop Cars, which will activate their sirens and hound the player when provoked. They can be attacked and destroyed, but do not count as opponents. A single ""Super Squad Car"" exists in one level, and it can be claimed if destroyed.
An Action Replay with multiple camera viewpoints is available at any point during a race.
Carmageddon won the “Game of the Year” trophy in the 1997 PC Zone Reader awards.
Carmageddon 1 & 2 were “Driving Game of the Year” 1997/1998.
SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME
Originally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time:
“Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...” - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10
“Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I've ever played… Carmageddon is God!” - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine
“Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.” - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6
“The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.” - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5
“So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon’s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.” - RetroGarden
Carmageddon is the first of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games. It was conceived and developed by Stainless Games, published by SCi and released June 30, 1997 on PC & Mac.
It was, and remains, a poster child for video game controversy. The controversy surrounded the game's central premise; that of earning reward for running down innocent pedestrians.
The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics, and for its in-game action replay features. It was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox 3D driving game, and may have influenced other later games including the Driver and Grand Theft Auto series.
ABOUT STAINLESS GAMES
Stainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.
Stainless Games now employs around one hundred mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.

It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.
GoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.
Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.",,,Nintendo 64,Shooter,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive, true exclusive",Rare,Nintendo,1997

The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.Story / Background In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of ""Consciousness Repository""). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called ""patterning."" Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines.Key information Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine.Game features
Upon release, the original TA game boasted:	Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types — for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape.
True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield.
Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons.
More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign. The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units (including the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types. Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection kbot!
Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side's leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist's home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events.
Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units.
Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads.
Variables such as gravity, tides, and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production.
Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar, the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units, and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages.
Over the years, the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player's TA experience. Numerous utilities, missions, mods, and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today. Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting, allowing for mass unit transporting, instant map-wide teleportation, upgradeable units, and true shields — plus much more. Don't forget to visit File Universe and Unit Universe to download and test the TA community's many maps, missions, mods, races, standalone units, utilities, and other extras!More information You can find more detailed information about the many aspects of TA — including the perfect installation, troubleshooting techniques, and tutorials on how to use / create third-party mods, units, maps, and missions — in TA FAQ.

It is the first game of the Final Fantasy Tactics series and was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998. The game combines thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other 32-bit era Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters.
Final Fantasy Tactics is set in a fictional medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice, created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.
A spin-off title, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, was released for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2003 and a sequel to that title, Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift, was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS. Various other games have also utilized the Ivalice setting, including Vagrant Story for the PlayStation and Final Fantasy XII for the PlayStation 2. An enhanced port of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, was released in 2007 as part of Square Enix's Ivalice Alliance project. Overall, the game received positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites and has become a cult classic since its release.",,,"PlayStation, Android, iOS","Adventure, RPG, Simulation","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Fantasy, Controller, War, history, memory, square","Square Enix, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square, SquareSoft","Square Enix, Sony Computer Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square",1997

It was released on 21 November 1997 in Japan and Europe and 24 November 1997 in North America. The game is set in ""Timber's Island"" and revolves around Diddy Kong and his friends' attempt to defeat the intergalactic pig-wizard antagonist, Wizpig, through winning a series of races. The player can take control of any of the featured characters throughout the game. Diddy Kong Racing features five worlds with four racetracks each, and the ability to drive a car, hovercraft, or pilot an aeroplane.
Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2, and was intended to be a real-time strategy game known as Wild Cartoon Kingdom during early stages. As time progressed, the game shifted from a Walt Disney World-influenced racing game to a unique title named Pro-Am 64, in which Nintendo had no involvement with. Due to the delays of Banjo-Kazooie, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to revolve a game around the character of Diddy Kong.
Diddy Kong Racing received critical acclaim upon release. The graphics, audio and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game, however minor criticism was directed at its repetitiveness. The game has sold 4.8 million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo 64's eighth best-selling game. A cancelled sequel, Donkey Kong Racing, was in development for the GameCube, however it was abandoned after Microsoft's purchase of Rare for £375 million in 2002.

57601,mega-man-x4,Mega Man X4 (1997),1997-08-01,,4.33,57,0,135,0,0,"Mega Man X4, originally released in Japan as Rockman X4 (ロックマンX4), is a video game developed by Capcom. It is the fourth game in the Mega Man X series and the second game in the series to be released on the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. The two versions were released simultaneously in Japan in 1997. A North America release followed sometime thereafter, while Europe received only the PlayStation version in 1997.
Taking place in the 22nd century, the Mega Man X series is set in a society populated by humans and intelligent robots called ""Reploids"". A military taskforce called the ""Maverick Hunters"" is implemented to suppress the uprising of ""Mavericks"", Reploids that begin to exhibit dangerous and destructive behavior. Mega Man X4 follows two such hunters, Mega Man X and Zero, as they become involved in a conflict between the Hunters and a Reploid army called the ""Repliforce"". Mega Man X4 is an action-platform game in the same vein as other installments in the series. The player completes a set of eight stages in any order while fighting enemies, gaining power-ups, and winning the special weapon of each stage's boss. Unlike previous games in the series, Mega Man X4 allows the player to choose between the two protagonists at the beginning of the game: X, who uses traditional, long-range attacks; or Zero, who wields a short-range sword.
Critical reception for Mega Man X4 has been generally positive. Critics praised the ability to play as either X or Zero, a concept many found to expand upon the then perceived exhausted gameplay formula of the Mega Man X sub-franchise during the 1990s. However, it was criticized for its poor voice acting and lack of innovation. In addition to its console versions, the game was released on Windows worldwide in 1998 and 1999 and on Japanese mobile phones in 2011 and 2012. It was also included on the Mega Man X Collection, a compilation released in North America on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in 2006. Mega Man X4 was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line for North America and Japan in 2014.",,,"SEGA Saturn, PlayStation, PC",Action,"Singleplayer, online","Capcom, Sony Interactive Entertainment","Capcom, Virgin Interactive, Japan",1997

The damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities. Australia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there.

It is the first game in the Mega Man Legends sub-series of Mega Man games from Capcom, and the first major 3D polygonal Mega Man title released in the franchise. It was released on the PlayStation in 1997 in Japan and in 1998 in North America. A Nintendo 64 port was released in 2000 with the same title, but it was renamed Mega Man 64 for the English release in 2001. Another port was released for Microsoft Windows in 2001, and PlayStation Portable in 2005, with the latter exclusively in Japan.
It stars a different spiritual incarnation of Mega Man named Mega Man Volnutt, the game's playable character. Mega Man Volnutt is a ""Digger"", a person in charge of investigating ruins from a flooded Earth. During his journey with his friends, their ship crashes in Kattelox Island, where Mega Man decides to confront pirates who are attacking it to obtain its hidden treasure. As an action-adventure game, Mega Man Legends's gameplay is very different from the ones of the original series despite sharing a few elements.
The game was produced by Keiji Inafune who remarks that he and the Capcom staff enjoyed designing the game. Since its original release Mega Man Legends has received positive critical response due the series jump from 2D graphics to 3D. Ports for the Nintendo 64 and Windows received negative comments for lacking updates from the PlayStation version whose graphics were considered outdated by the time the ports were released. Nevertheless, critics have praised Mega Man Legends as an enjoyable game in the Mega Man series. Mega Man Legends was followed by the prequel The Misadventures of Tron Bonne and a sequel titled Mega Man Legends 2.",,,"PC, PlayStation","Action, Adventure, RPG","Singleplayer, online, island, treasure","Capcom, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Capcom Production Studio 2","Capcom, Virgin Interactive, PAL",1997

It then received ports to the Sega Saturn in 1998 and the PlayStation in 1999.
The gameplay and aesthetics of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter remain similar to X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Each player selects two characters to compete in a one-on-one tag team fight, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The game replaces most of the X-Men cast from the previous installment with characters from other Marvel properties. In addition, it introduces a new gameplay mechanic known as the ""Variable Assist"", which would be used in future Marvel vs. Capcom titles.
Much like its predecessor, the game received generally positive reviews for its gameplay, sprite animations, and character roster. The Sega Saturn version, utilizing the 4 MB RAM expansion cartridge, was praised for being an arcade-perfect conversion. Due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation, tag team battles were, once again, removed from its port, resulting in more mixed critical reception.

Blast Corps was released to universal acclaim and received Metacritic's second highest Nintendo 64 ratings of 1997. The game sold one million copies—lower than the team's expectations—and received several editor's choice awards.

The game was later published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) in North America on March 25, 1998. It is the seventh game in the SaGa series and the first to be released on the PlayStation.
SaGa Frontier was developed by the then-Square Production Team 2 (referred to as 2nd Division in the game) with Akitoshi Kawazu as director and producer, Koichi Ishii as planning chief, Kenji Ito as composer, and Tomomi Kobayashi as illustrator. Square Production Team 2 included Kyoji Koizumi, Miwa Shoda, Kazuko Shibuya, and Minoru Akao among others. The musical score for SaGa Frontier was composed and arranged by Kenji Ito, who provided music for many previous entries in the SaGa franchise. When development began, the game's title was intended to be Romancing SaGa 4. The focus shifted from the traditional SaGa style and began to focus on several different character on their own journeys. Nine stories were crafted, but two of them were dropped for being too comedic.
The plot of SaGa Frontier takes place in a science fantasy universe called ""The Regions"", a group of worlds with varying degrees of culture, unique races, technology, and magic. The game allows the player to follow the exploits of one of seven protagonists, each with his or her own storyline and goal. The game's ""Free Scenario System"" offers a large amount of non-linear gameplay, allowing the player to freely travel between many of the Regions, interact with other characters, and take part in turn-based combat.

Trouble Makers (ゆけゆけ!!トラブルメーカーズ) is a 1997 side-scrolling platform video game developed by Treasure and published by Enix and Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in 2.5D.
The game was the first 2D side-scrolling game for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began Mischief Makers's development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant ""catching"" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.
The game received ""mixed or average reviews"", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised Mischief Makers's inventiveness, personality, and boss fights, but criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low replay value, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature ""Shake, shake!"" sound bite as a highlight. Video game journalists cited Mischief Makers as ripe for reissue either through the Nintendo eShop or in a sequel or franchise reboot.

Have you ever had an obsession? Anything. To buy a sports car, to build a country house, to find true love, to collect all rare stamps?
What is it? Dream? The purpose of life? Or is it just a mental parasite that has settled in your mind? Any way, your life is no longer a mere existence. Now it is the path. A path that can lead anywhere. A path full of difficulties and questions.
The main character is an example of a person who goes to his goal. No matter what it is, no matter how big it is.
For example - the main character is looking for milk. Does it sound silly? Let it be.
How does it feel?
Katharsis is a first person exploration game, where you will face a bunch of choices and simple puzzles. Sooner or later those choices will lead you to the end of a story. There are a few endings and together they will provide a full game experience.

According to Legend, When this Universe Was Created, A Master Key was Forged to Lock Away All Ancient Secrets and Infinite Powers The Cosmos Had to Offer.
The Key was then divided and cast into different circles of reality for safe keeping. These realities are joined together by one-way portals, or Dark Rifts, and only the individual who possesses a piece of the Master Key may cross the threshold into the next dimension. Upon crossing, the Dark Rift will seal itself and disappear.
It is said that when the pieces of the Master Key are reunited, the dimensions will converge to reveal the true center of the universe. The point of convergence is known as the Vortex. However, only the holder of the entire, re-forged Master Key may enter the Vortex and claim its immeasurable power.
STORY
When the Hyperions accidentally acquired a piece of the Master Key, now named the Core Prime Element, they abused its power and proclaimed themselves the Chosen Ones. After many years of tyrannical rule, their society became morally destitute and internally corrupt. In the midst of this political and social chaos, Sonork Nezom arose as the Chosen One's demented Emperor. With the help of his sordid followers, Sonork enslaved the mass populace, murdered any possible opposition, and claimed the Core Primer Element as his own.
For many years, the Chosen Ones' malevolent rule was noted throughout the universe, and while many desired the Core Prime Element, only one entity sought the prize with vitilant fervor. Demitron, the Lord Demon of the Dark Dimension, waited until the time was right to demand the invaluable prize from the envied Chosen Ones. When Snork Nezom came into power, Demitron knew his chance had come.
In an effort to retrieve the Core Prime Element and assassinate Sonork, Demitron sent his most hideous servant, Demonica Gkroux, through the dimensional portal to do his bidding. When the Arch Demon Demonica failed her mission to murder Sonork, she unhesitatingly exchanged secret information for her life. She told Sonork that, aside from his Core Prime Element, there were at least two other known pieces of the Master Key. Demonica also revealed that while the Light Prime Element's Location had never been discovered, the Dark Prime Element was embedded in her lord master's head.
After listening to Demonica's tale, Sonork resolved to procure the Light Prime Element and combine its powers with the Core Prime Element already in his possession. Hereasoned that if he had two pieces of Master Key, his powers would be so ominous that he would be able to seize Demitron's Dark Prime Element effortlessly.
THE TOURNAMENT
Because warriors from around the universe have continuously failed in their attempt to obtain the Core Prime Element and usurp Sonork, he is confident that there is no being who can overpower him in his dimension. With this belief, Sonork has created the most lethal and prestigious battle, The Tournament. Using his piece of the Master Key as the ultimate prize, Sonork is confident that the holder of the Prime Light Element will be lured to his realm. When he battles the desired holder and secures the Light Prime Element, Sonork plans to challenge the formidable Demitron and ascend to absolute and universal supremacy.

Overview
In this first person horror game, immerse yourself in the dark otherworldly horror of the medieval.
A long and dangerous road awaits the chosen Pilgrims. You will journey to find out what lies at the end of the road.
Thrust from the safety of your Village, given little supplies and a powered wagon. Take yourself and your companions through a dark world to find what awaits you along this winding path.
To survive you’ll have to delve deep into crypts, unlock dimly lit dungeons, explore the derelict towns and try not to lose yourself in the twisting woodlands.
In this solo or multiplayer dark adventure be sure to take a light with you into the dark places of the world.
Equipment
But dear Pilgrim - all is not so bleak. You will take with you a Wagon, one of the Village’s last remaining remnants of the old world. It’s fitted with a crystalline engine that powers it towards the user’s will - trust it and it will take you to where you need to be.
However, that is not all. The Village’s best and most cunning craftsmen have devised a dial that can divine the time of day! The three distinct time zones of Day, Night and Deep Night will be signified by this dial and a bell. Don’t be caught away from the wagon after day.
You might also happen across a friendly merchant who is all too willing to supply you with his wears.
Use items to help you navigate the world, fight off creatures and perhaps have a little fun along the way.
Monsters
We know you won’t be alone - we’ve seen them out there. The Monsters.
Encounter a range of different creatures - just a brief encounter might result in the end of your pilgrimage.
Death is not the end!
If you're playing with friends you can be brought back from death - but at what cost?
Friends
You don’t have to do it alone. You might get lucky and this year’s Pilgrimage could get a good batch of travellers all ready to ride alongside you in your wagon. But it’s up to you to do the recruiting! Get your friends online and see if you can make it to the end of The Road.

52918,fifa-manager,FIFA Manager,1997-01-01,,0.0,1,0,7,0,0,"FIFA Manager (short: FIFAM) was an association football series of sport management games published by Electronic Arts. The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game.
Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped.
However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager).
One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC Fútbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager José Mourinho was selected for the main cover.
While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.",,,PlayStation,,Singleplayer,Electronic Arts Sports,EA SPORTS,1997

When attacked, the player enters a side-view screen full of enemies, and the player must fight them in a turn-based format with two characters: the swordsman protagonist, who attacks with sword and shield, and a flying creature called Wokuu, who can take on distant enemies and keep the swordsman afloat for brief spells.",,,SNES,"Adventure, RPG",,Game Freak,T&E; Soft,1997

It contributed largely to the boom of music games in 1998, and the series expanded not only with arcade sequels, but also moved to home consoles and other portable devices, achieving a million unit sales. The Bemani line of music games from Konami is named after the series, and was first adopted in the arcade release of Beatmania 3rdMix and kept ever since. The series came to an end with the last game being Beatmania The Final, released in 2002.
Beatmania gave birth to several spinoffs, such as the Beatmania IIDX series (a more advanced version featuring 7 keys and higher difficulty levels) and the other being Beatmania III, a remake of the 5-key series which featured a more modern hardware platform, a pedal for optional effects and a 3.5"" floppy disk drive to save play records.
While the series was never ported to home computers, there have been unlicensed hard-drive copies which made it playable on a computer's keyboard, or even with a modded PlayStation controller. Its popularity led to non-official simulators, with one of the most popular being BM98.
Beatmania and its variants have a following in Japan and all around the world. The password based Internet Ranking service allowed competition wherever a machine is available. Today in the United States, many of the original beatmania cabinets are in the hands of arcade collectors and Bemani enthusiasts, and consequently are a rare sight at many arcades.",,,"PlayStation, Game Boy",,"exclusive, true exclusive","Konami Digital Entertainment, List of Bemani series",Konami,1997

Atelier Marie takes place in a fantasy medieval world of magic, however, as the narrator soon points out, most people actually live quite ordinary lives. As the grand adventures are left to the few chosen ones, the wide majority are content with their mundane lifestyles as long as there's peace in the world.
Capital of Schigsal Kingdom, Salburg, is home to the famous Salburg Academy, which specializes in the studies of alchemy. The school is revered as producing some of the best alchemists on the entire continent. The game's main protagonist Marie is getting the worst grades in the academy's history. Despite her embarrassment, Marie constantly tries to improve herself, but also constantly fails. Miserably failing at alchemy, her instructor Ingrid decides that Marie needs to be taught with unconventional methods.
Ingrid allows Marie to open her own workshop to practice her alchemy outside of class while still continuing her studies.

It is a free video game with an ASCII interface in which the user (playing the eponymous robot and represented by a number sign ""#"") must find kitten (represented by a random character) on a field of other random characters. Walking up to items allows robot to identify them as either kitten, or any of a variety of ""Non-kitten Items"" (NKIs) with whimsical, strange or simply random text descriptions. It is not possible to lose (though there is a patch that adds a 1 in 10 probability of the NKI killing robot). Simon Carless has characterized robotfindskitten as ""less a game and more a way of life ... It's fun to wander around until you find a kitten, at which point you feel happy and can start again"".
The original robotfindskitten program was the sole entrant to a contest in 1997 at the now-defunct webzine Nerth Pork — the object: create a depiction of ""robotfindskitten"". (The ""robotfindskitten"" concept was originally created by Jacob Berendes, but the only submission he received depicted kittens meeting an untimely end at the hands of malevolent robots.)
When the author rewrote the program for Linux in 1999, it gained popularity and now has its own website and mailing lists. Since then, it has been ported to and/or implemented on over 30 platforms, including POSIX, the Dreamcast, Palm OS, TI 99/4A, the Z-machine, the Sony PSP, Android, and many more.

Lexicon is a single-player puzzle adventure game that invites players to solve mind-bending challenges using familiar 2000s-style flash game mechanics while telling a unique story about a person who finds themselves in the mysterious, and sometimes highly quirky, world of Ekkos.
Immerse yourself in the enigmatic and delightfully eccentric world of Ekkos as you traverse Babel’s 6 unique domains, meet its peculiar inhabitants, and discover its hidden secrets.
EKKOS
The realm between life and death is visited by few as most beings are unaware of its existence. Although Ekkos is made up of several habitable layers, most beings live in the layer known as Babel.
Babel consists of 6 unique geographical domains that each possess their own people and problems. In Lexicon, you will navigate through each of these domains to ultimately escape from the world between worlds.
CHARACTERS
As you travel through Ekkos, you will interact with a diverse array of beings of various personalities, ideologies and idiosyncrasies. Some of them might seem shy at first, but don’t be afraid to engage them more than once! If prodded enough, these characters may reveal more about themselves, and they might just surprise you…
With its classic ¾ perspective and enchanting vector art, Lexicon will challenge your wits and evoke the nostalgia of 2000s-style web games as you solve head-scratching conundrums.
INDUS
Some speakers of the long lost language have the ability to manifest words into physical form. On your journey, you will need to learn new words in Indus to explore the various Domains each containing their own elemental characteristics.
POWERS
The origin of your powers is a mystery, yet mastery of them will prove essential to overcoming difficult challenges. Powers like Time Stop can be used in combination with Indus to pass through dangerous environments.

It's a heavy emotional story about suicide and an otherworldly train… among other things. It's quite unlike anything else – a flawed diamond, forgotten by time – which is why I decided to translate it to English over two decades after its original release!

For ease of use, the game comes bundled with a pre-configured PC-98 emulator – just run the program, and you're off! If you're on Mac or Linux, or if you want the full 1997 experience, you can set up a PC-98 emulator (like Neko Project II) and plug in one of the disk images offered.

The game has an immensely interesting backstory – it was created in a particular niche of Japanese indie game history, which has barely if at all been covered in English.

Tamagotchi 2' (otherwise known as ゲームで発見！！たまごっち2) is a Nintendo Game Boy title released on October 17, 1997  in Japan. It features forest and ocean-dwelling Tamagotchi characters, both of which would later be adapted into the physical handheld series: 'Mori de Hakken! Tamagotchi' (Forest Discovery! Tamagotchi) and 'Tamagotchi Ocean'.  
-
Being the second installment of the Tamagotchi video game series, it greatly expands upon its gameplay mechanics and Tamagotchi roster. For starters, it offers the player the choice of two modes: 'Adventure Mode' and 'Tamagotchi Care Mode'. Selecting adventure mode puts the player in the shoes of Mikachu, a girl residing in a village, who can explore freely in search of items (used for care mode), or to simply visit the residents to gain advice or learn more about their home. Extra minigames are also included in this mode.

Tamagotchi Care Mode works similarly to the first Tamagotchi Game Boy title, where the player fosters an egg until it hatches, and continues to care for it until it evolves (or matures) into different types of Tamagotchi- dependent on how it's cared for. However, neglecting the Tamagotchi for too long will cause it to pass away, forcing the player to start with a new egg. 

Unlike its first installment, the player can bring up two Tamagotchi pets at once: one terrarium for forest creatures, and the other, a tank, for ocean dwellers.",,,Game Boy,"Strategy, Simulation, Casual","Management, evolution, japanese, egg, growth, Game Boy, tamagotchi, handheld, pet-simulator, care-game",Tom Create,Bandai,1997

In Top Skater, players stand on a skateboard-like platform which swung side-to-side or tilted, manipulating the actions of the avatars in the game. The game has ramps, rails and other skating objects from which the player can do tricks to gain points.[1] The player has a limited amount of time in which to perform tricks, but can extend this time by collecting time bonus rings or by performing certain tricks.

Kenji Kanno went on to create the Crazy Taxi series, which has similar character art design and music. Top Skater also served as a basic foundation for later skateboarding games including Activision's Tony Hawk's series. Top Skater had a sequel called Air Trix, released by Sega for arcades in 2001.",,,,Sports,,Sega-AM3,SEGA,1997
