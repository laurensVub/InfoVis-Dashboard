EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is a 20 beta minute experience that subverts the war-game genre as players must choose to combat or collaborate with others.
As a documentarian I am inspired by real life situations and stories and in 2014, I was lucky enough to meet two men whose story changed my life and that of many others. Zahed and Najah are former enemy soldiers who have become blood brothers for life. Zahed was an Iranian child soldier during the Iran-Iraq War when he found Najah, an enemy soldier, injured in a bunker. Zahed made a split-second decision in the heat of the battlefield and instead of shooting Najah, he risked his own life to save him. I was deeply inspired by Zahed's ability to recognize the humanity in his enemy. His act of bravery has had lasting ramifications in both their lives and those of their families.
I documented their story in a film, MY ENEMY, MY BROTHER, which resonated strongly with audiences across the world. It landed on the Oscar shortlist, was nominated for an Emmy award, and premiered as a NYTimes OpDoc in 2015. The film evolved into a feature documentary, which premiered at Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival in 2017. The strong international response to the films, as well as feedback in the Q and A sessions, led us to explore the film’s core themes further. We wanted to bring the remarkable empathy that Najah and Zahed felt for one another into a unique space, where audiences would be able to step into their shoes and make choices for themselves, that could make them rethink their decisions in real life. We developed what is now the EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR immersive experience.
The EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR subverts the war-game genre to explore how we judge one another as friend or foe. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is set in a conflict zone, but in essence each decision reflects the kind of snap judgement made in school yards, street corners and board rooms across the globe. Do I trust this person? Are they friendly or a threat? Should I collaborate with this person or fight them?
As the player faces each challenge in the bunker and decides whether or not to collaborate with the other soldiers, their decisions affect how the other soldier responds to them, and ultimately determines who makes it out alive. As the player discovers in the end, their decisions also impact the welfare of nearby communities.",,,"PC, SEGA CD, Game Boy Advance, Atari Lynx, SNES, Commodore / Amiga","Adventure, RPG, Casual, Indie","Singleplayer, First-Person, Choices Matter, Cinematic, VR, Multiple Endings, Visual Novel, Choose Your Own Adventure, Education, Character Action Game, Experimental, Tracked Controller Support, VR Supported, Documentary","Westwood Studios, Strategic Simulations, Westwood Associates, Reptoid Games","SEGA, Capcom, Strategic Simulations, Infogrames Entertainment, Pony Canyon, Fathom Film Group",1990

Ten years ago, WIZARDRY set the standards in Fantasy Role-Playing (FRP). Now after two million copies have been sold and dozens of awards have been won, Bane of the Cosmic Forge raises and redefines those standards. This new WIZARDRY, the truest simulation ever of Fantasy Role Playing, will push your computer, your mind, and your sense of adventure to their very limits. Only through the power of the latest computer technology could the full dimensions of this new genre in FRP be possible.
This is FRP the way you wanted it to be.
Prepare yourself. Take with you six companions - choose wisely, for having chosen, your fate is in their hands. Enter the ancient castle to retrieve the Cosmic Forge, a magical pen whose writings caused the river of time itself to change course. You will find treasure, armor, and magic items to advance your quest; meet wizened and cryptic dwellers who hold secrets that must be unearthed; and solve the riddles and puzzles that abound.
But beware- you and your party will encounter countless dangers, hazards, and creatures of dazzling form to block your way. Only through your magic and skills, ever growing as you progress, can they be vanquished.
And the story, so rich in mythology and legend, weaves a web of intrigue so complex that only you, with patience and travail can unravel.
Let the computer roll the dice, consult the charts and apply the rules. From the 400 items of armor and weaponry researched for authenticity to the realistic combat structure, incorporating Primary and Secondary attack, this reproduction of true FRP within the computer environment will make all other attempts obsolete.

The Secret of Monkey Island is a 1990 point-and-click graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It takes place in a fantastic version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.
The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.",,,"macOS, PC, Atari ST, Classic Macintosh, SEGA CD, Commodore / Amiga",Adventure,"Singleplayer, Comedy, Point & Click, Dark Humor","LucasArts Entertainment, Lucasfilm","LucasArts Entertainment, Lucasfilm Games",1990

They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).

The NES version of the game, renamed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game in the West, features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.",,,"Xbox 360, Atari ST, NES, Commodore / Amiga","Action, Arcade","Music, battle, Cartoon, alien, guns, brain, fly, NES",Konami Digital Entertainment,Konami,1990

(ロックマン3 Dr.ワイリーの最期!?, ""Rockman 3: The End of Dr. Wily!?"") in Japan and Mega Man III in game, is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game of the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on September 28, 1990. The game localized in North America later in 1990 and in European regions in 1992. Taking place after the events of Mega Man 2, the plot follows the titular hero as he helps his creator, Dr. Light, and a former villain, Dr. Wily, collect parts for a peace-keeping robot by defeating several Robot Masters that have gone haywire.
A platform-action game, Mega Man 3 follows the same format set forth by its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.
Following the success of Mega Man 2 released two years earlier, Mega Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, Mega Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, and as part of various Mega Man franchise compilations.",,,"iOS, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, PSP, PlayStation 3, Android, Wii U, PlayStation, NES",Action,Singleplayer,Capcom,"Capcom, Nintendo",1990

Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze.

Anri, a youth from Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using the divine sword Falchion. The Kingdom of Archanea was restored and the world entered an era of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice in the care of a bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and Elice sacrifices herself so Marth can escape. Accompanied by a handful of knights, he takes refuge in the island nation of Talys.

Several years later, Marth repels a pirate invasion of Talys, leading its king to conclude that he is ready to battle Dolhr; he sends Marth out with several of his most trusted men and his daughter, Princess Caeda. Marth first rescues the kingdom of Aurelis and enlists the aid of its king's younger brother, Duke Hardin and his retainers. He meets Princess Nyna, the last survivor of the Archanean royal family and leader of the resistance against Dohlr. She gives him the Fire Emblem, a legendary treasure given to the hero destined to save the world. The two march to Archanea and free it from Grust's grasp. After briefly invading Khadein in search of Falchion, Marth retakes Altea. He learns that his mother was killed in the invasion and that Gharnef is holding Elice prisoner. Marth next battles Grust and their top general, Camus, who rescued Nyna from execution at Dohlrian hands; he chooses to uphold his honor as a knight of Grust, and Marth is forced to defeat him.

Marth is contacted by Gotoh, a wise old sage, who informs him that Gharnef wields the tome Imhullu, making him invincible; the only thing capable of defeating him is the magic of Starlight.

Sure, your starship is 15,000 feet long and armed with remote-controlled fightercraft, kamakazi fighters, a devestating plasma gun and high-tech probes, but will all that firepower be against The Stentor, rithless time-travelling space pirates, or the colossal energy beings known as The ZOR?
Perhaps diplomacy is the answer. The Cicisbeo are vain and arrogant - perhaps that ego can be worked to your advantage. The broodmasters are sinister, manipulative and seek universal domination, but are they a little too eager?
Perhaps something can be gained from shrewd trading. But that will be tough against the ever-seeking, ever-hungry Collectors, keepers of the Museum of Time; not to mention the supra-intelligent Jot, who control the minds of everyone nearby.

It was also released as a launch title for the SNES in August 1991 in North America, with a European release following in 1992.
Pilotwings is an amateur flight simulator game in which the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, and the use of a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.
The game was well received upon its release, largely thanks to its graphical presentation. The game has since been re-released on the Virtual Console service for both the Wii and the Wii U consoles in PAL regions, North America, and Japan, as well as for the New Nintendo 3DS in North America.

It features ultra-high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and superb sound effects. The animation and scrolling is updated at nearly 40 frames per second, for comparison, motion picture quality cartoons are filmed at only 24 frames per second.

The story of Commander Keen is epic, and in the style of the memorable matinee serials, like Flash Gordon. You play the role of Billy Blaze, an eight-year-old kid genius who builds an interstellar ship when not working at home on his college fast-track degree. Among other household objects, Billy uses his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his mom's vacuum cleaner (heavily modified) for his ship's ion propulsion system (with pile height adjustment).

At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football helmet and becomes ""Commander Keen"" defender of Earth! Ever on the side of justice, fairness, and high-calorie junk food, Keen dispenses justice with an iron hand.

Keen's first adventure takes you to Mars, where the Vorticon invasion force is planning their conquest of Earth. While Keen is exploring Mars the Vorticons steal pieces of his ship and hide them within their cities. Can Keen recover all the pieces and repel the Vorticon invasion? You'll explore many dangerous cities, packed with diabolical traps and hideous creatures, both of Martian and Vorticon origin.

The Forgotten Realms Archive - Collection One allows you to journey through one such set of adventures: the Eye of the Beholder trilogy, a set of first-person, real-time role-playing games.
Eye of the Beholder
A new evil is plaguing the city of Waterdeep, stalking the streets and preying on its citizens. Though initially thought to come from afar, this great evil, known only as Xanathar, instead resides within Waterdeep and, if not stopped, threatens to overwhelm the city. The Lords of Waterdeep believe that the evil lurks in the sewers below and have commissioned a party of adventurers to investigate and foil this nefarious plot. Granted full rights of marque and ownership of any treasure, artifacts or valuables you find on your quest, you must venture into the chasms, discover the nature of this evil and destroy it by any means necessary.

Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon
Following your quest in the sewers beneath, you and your party are recovering with Waterdeep’s finest healers, when a letter arrives from Khelben Blackstaff, mystic advisor to the Lords of Waterdeep. Trouble is brewing in the Northern and Western regions, and he has tasked you with exploring the land and investigating these incidents. Although nothing has been confirmed, renowned but troublesome archaeologist, Wently Kelso believes the disturbances are related to an evil uprising and the presence of a powerful ancient artefact. These troubles could, of course, simply be the work of unruly bandits, but since Kelso’s previous findings in the sewers of Waterdeep proved true,  one would be wise not to easily dismiss his opinion on the matter. Therefore, you should exercise greater care and vigilance as you begin your next adventure.

Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor
Having rid the sewers of Waterdeep and the dreaded Temple Darkmoon of the evil forces within, you and your companions are surely deserving of a strong drink, good food and a warm fire. And so, your first port of call is to the nearest tavern, where you slop ale all over yourself and engage in jovial antics as you regale your adventures to your captivated listeners and admirers. However, in the midst of your retelling, the tavern door is thrust open by a hooded figure, whose eyes scan the crowd before locking on you and your party. Approaching you, he quickly introduces himself and explains his reasons for disturbing the festivities; his master wishes you to free the ruined city of Myth Drannor from the clutches of a Lich and restore it to its former glory. Looks like your adventures aren’t over just yet…
With an original story set in the Forgotten Realms universe, the Eye of the Beholder trilogy is based on the Advanced Dungeon & Dragons 2nd Edition’s game rules.

It is the sequel to the 1979 arcade game Monaco GP.
The arcade game consists mostly of one race: the Grand Prix of Monaco (though represented by a totally different track, albeit with the same features of the real-life Circuit de Monaco). The player simply chooses a transmission type, qualifies, and race. The player must qualify in under 45 seconds in the shortened track in order to actually race. If he fails, the game ends (though, in the home versions, even if the player fails to qualify, he still starts off the race at the last position). When in the race itself, there is also a position limit, which starts off on 20th (15th in the home versions) and decreases as the player bypasses checkpoints along the track, ultimately stopping on 3rd. If the player falls behind the indicated position and does not manage to recover fast enough, a game over happens.
The game was one of the first games to include a rear-view mirror, along with Winning Run. The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version of Super Monaco GP adds a World Championship mode. In the World Championship mode, the goal is to win a season of races, and then go on to defend the title. The circuits are modeled on the ones used in the 1989 Formula One season, with background scenery similar to the real-world circuit venues, though without the wealth of details the Arcade version had. This Mega Drive/Genesis version was also released in arcades for the Sega Mega-Tech system board in 1990.",,,"SEGA Master System, Game Gear, Atari ST, Commodore / Amiga, Genesis",Racing,Singleplayer,SEGA,"SEGA, U.S. Gold",1990

By 1992 there were also MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amstrad CPC versions available. It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.
The game was the first Dizzy game not to be developed entirely by Dizzy's creators, the Oliver Twins. Instead, whilst they were focusing on other projects, Magicland Dizzy was designed by Neal Vincent and coded by external developer Big Red Software. The Oliver Twins retained design-approval oversight.
The game is sometimes alternatively known by its development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible at the top of the game screen, behind the player's score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series games again. The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms.

The series consists of six main episodes, a ""lost"" episode, and a final game; all but the final game were originally released for MS-DOS in 1990 and 1991, while the 2001 Commander Keen was released for the Game Boy Color. The series follows the titular Commander Keen, the secret identity of the eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, as he defends the Earth and the galaxy from alien threats with his homemade spaceship, rayguns, and pogo stick. The first three episodes were developed by Ideas from the Deep, the precursor to id, and published by Apogee Software as the shareware title Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons; the ""lost"" episode 3.5 Commander Keen in Keen Dreams was developed by id and published as a retail title by Softdisk; episodes four and five were released by Apogee as the shareware Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy; and the simultaneously developed episode six was published in retail by FormGen as Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Ten years later, a homage and sequel to the series was developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision as Commander Keen.
Invasion of the Vorticons was the only game developed by Ideas from the Deep, and was based on programmer John Carmack's creation of adaptive tile refresh, a technique that allowed IBM-compatible general-purpose computers to replicate the smooth scrolling of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game's success caused designer Tom Hall, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, and artist Adrian Carmack to found id Software. Their obligations to Softdisk, where they had worked during development of the game, led to the creation of Keen Dreams as a prototype for the second trilogy of episodes. The final episode was split off during development into a stand-alone retail title, and plans for a third trilogy were cancelled after the success of Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993). The final Keen game ten years later had oversight but little development work from id.
Critical reception and the series' legacy has focused on the two main trilogies of episodes, with Vorticons having large success as a shareware game and impacting the success of Apogee (now 3D Realms) and its shareware model. The second trilogy sold fewer copies, which was blamed by id and Apogee on its split into two parts, and the 2001 game received mixed reviews. The MS-DOS games have been re-released in several compilation packages, and all but the sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on platforms such as Steam. References to the series have been made by dozens of other games, especially to the Dopefish, an enemy in the fourth episode, which has been termed one of the video game industry's biggest in-jokes.

The game featured one of the first 3D polygon driving environments via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture. The force feedback, car physics simulator, game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky. According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland.
Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's engineers and designers, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point.
Hard Drivin' was released in February 1989, when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin' is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run.
In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German and Japanese versions.

While the first game was an adaptation of a novel trilogy, Megami Tensei II has an original story that examines preconceptions surrounding the portrayal of order and chaos.

The game received critical acclaim upon release, was partially remade in the 1992 Super Famicom title Shin Megami Tensei, and is regarded as an influential entry in the series.

The player takes control of the knight Apollo, the god of the sun, who sets off on the legendary winged horse Pegasus, to rescue his lover, Artemis, the goddess of the moon, from the Titan, Typhon. The game takes names and little else from Greek mythology in which Apollo, god of the sun, was actually Artemis's brother. The game shows players an Artemis that acts as an stereotypical princess (but in Greek mythology, she was the goddess of the hunt, and took pride in never being with any man).
The arcade version of this game was never released in the United States, due to Artemis's ""bondage/torture"" scenes, which were shown between each stage, and were similar to those from the new version of Namco's own Rolling Thunder; while no nudity is shown, the scenes were still somewhat ""strong"" to be shown in an arcade game during the early 16-bit era.

The game is set within the Official Traveller Universe and features character creation and other aspects of game mechanics compatible with prior Traveller products. The player controls up to five ex-military adventurers whose objective is to save their civilization, the Imperium, from a conspiracy instigated by the Zhodani, a rival spacefaring race, and aided by the actions of a traitor named Konrad Kiefer. Gameplay features real-time planetary and space exploration, combat, trading, and interaction with various non-player characters in eight solar systems containing twenty-eight visitable planets.
Development presented Paragon with technical challenges because this game, distributed on floppy disks for computers hosting as little as 512 KB RAM, simulates the detailed game mechanics of the Traveller tabletop role-playing games within a sizable game world. To meet the difficulties posed by these hardware limitations, Paragon chose to excise or simplify some elements familiar to players of earlier Traveller games. Reception upon the release of the game was very mixed. Some reviewers rated it highly and praised its playability and depth of gameplay. Others reviewed the game less favorably; substantial criticism was directed towards its handling of ground combat.

Then there was Battle Command.
The game sees you take command of a futuristic assault tank, dropped by Helicarrier right into the middle of the action on the battlefield. While many other 3D efforts of the time resulted in confusing wireframes or framerates measured in spf instead of fps, Battle Command’s fully-filled polygons were a breath of fresh air… until that air was filled with the acrid smoke from the burning wrecks of enemy buildings and vehicles!
With multiple camera views allowing the player to sit in the belly of the beast or to see the action from a third-person perspective – a real innovation at the time – this much-loved ‘command’ game focused more on outright fighting that the strategic elements of similar titles. Yet it was not all simply ready-aim-fire; the player still has to equip the most suitable ammunition to satisfactorily complete each one of the exciting and varied missions.According to the original box art:Set in the near future of an alternative reality, Battle Command is an arcade/strategy game in which the player controls a single ‘Mauler’ Assault Tank in one of sixteen scenarios in the ultra-war, fought between two dominant races in the New World. The latest phase of this north/south war has been going on for over ten years with a stalemate eventually developing – a stand-off between armies massed over a long dug-in battle front.
Such are the defensive capabilities of each side, full scale assaults are suicidal, so any offensive moves are, by necessity, small behind-the-lines actions performed by elite troops in specially designed vehicles. The Mauler is the latest such machine – capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by fast stealth choppers and armed with the most advanced weaponry the northern sides can devise.

The flashlight held between your teeth casts a dim light on the combination locks in the otherwise pitch-black vault. Near-inaudible clicks tap out the rhythm of the delicate dance of your heist as your trembling hands coax the discs into place with precise movements of the dials. The silent alarm was tripped minutes ago and the police are on their way. But you’re not backing out now — you came for fortune, and you’re not leaving without it.
Revelation is an intense arcade-style puzzle game from Krisalis where you spin color-coded interconnected dials inside clockwork locks to match colors and create chain reactions to open each safe. Thinking ahead is crucial, as each lock will affect adjacent locks when spun. These tricky puzzles would be difficult on their own, but they’re made even more challenging with the addition of a timer counting down the time until you’re caught red-handed breaking in. Keep one eye on the dials, and another on the lookout for collectibles that appear on the screen to give you additional time, stop the clock, and more. Finish each puzzle before time runs out, grab the loot, and get out of there!
Over 80 puzzling stages of increasingly complex safe-cracking gameplay, including bonus stages where you have ten seconds to figure out the one move which will solve the entire safe. Choose wisely!
Quickly solve each stage to plunder the safe for valuables — some of which can be used to help you in later stages

Alpha Waves was an abstract game with a moody, artistic presentation, named for its supposed ability to stimulate the different emotional centers of the brain with its use of color and music.
It was developed initially for the Atari ST by Christophe de Dinechin, and later ported to the Amiga and DOS. The DOS port was done by Frédérick Raynal, a notable game designer who would go on to develop Alone in the Dark (often abbreviated AitD), and Little Big Adventure. He has said that his work on Alpha Waves was a major inspiration for the 3D engine for Alone in the Dark. The PC version was also localized in North America by Data East, and retitled Continuum. Infogrames may have also published their own version in the US under the original title, and it was also released as a part of no less than two Infogrames compilations, on which it retained its original name.

The game's villain had shut down all the Compuminds and hid them. Eventually one of the Compuminds, named Kakos, was found. Together, Rad and Kakos must find the eight missing Compuminds, each on eight different unique planets, such as the cyberpunk world of Cyberia, the green jungle world of Sauria, and the caustic trash world of Effluvia.
The game was notable for the planet Turvia, where gravity works in reverse. In that level the protagonist was drawn upside down, as were the enemies and the entire screen. The main character has a comically large head and strongly resembles actor Bruce Campbell. His early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.

He previously worked as head game designer for Audiogenic, who acquired exclusive rights to the game, then in 1990 arranged for Mindscape to publish it for computers in North America and consoles worldwide.
The Nintendo Entertainment System version (programmed by Bits Studios) and the Game Boy version (programmed by Argonaut Software) were released in 1990. A sequel, Super Loopz, was published for the Super NES by Imagineer and for the Commodore Amiga CD32 by Audiogenic. Audiogenic also published versions of the original game for the Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, and IBM PC in 1990 and 1991.
An Apple Macintosh version was in development for Audiogenic, but never completed, and a version was written for the Atari Lynx, also for Audiogenic by Hand Made Software but lay unreleased until picked up by Songbird Productions in 2004.
An agreement was reached between Audiogenic Software and the defunct Atari Classics Programmer's Club in 1995 for development of an Atari 800XL version of the game. This version remained incomplete by the time it was abandoned in October 1998. There was some discussion in 2005 over the possibility of resurrecting this version of the game but the project remains on hold.
Audiogenic licensed the Loopz concept to Capcom who developed a prototype coin-op, but it was never released. Similarly Audiogenic developed an SWP (skill-with-prizes) version on behalf of Barcrest, a leading UK manufacturer of pub games, and this too remains unreleased.
The main focus is on the playing board where random pieces of different shapes are presented to the player. A shape is either a single square containing a straight line or 90° corner or a combination of multiple such squares. The player must then try to make loops out of them. Once a loop is completed, all pieces involved will disappear. (You cannot make any line overlapping the edge, in other words, it cannot be placed in this way)
There exist three different play modes, two of which can be played with two players. The third mode of play starts with a loop already created and then takes away random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in after they show up.

This game also features a cameo re-appearance, from Valkyrie (as in no Densetsu), who appears to report the final outcome of a match once it has finished, and Namco's signature character Pac-Man can also be seen on two of the television screens in her studio wearing a purple bow tie (in his Pac-Land-style anthropomorphized form, as opposed to his ""original"" one).",,,Genesis,Sports,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",NAMCO,Namco,1990

One or two players control a P-38 (for player 1) or a Mosquito (for player 2), shooting enemy airplanes and ships. As in the previous games, one button shoots the airplane's weapon (which is upgradeable by collecting power ups left by enemies) and the other makes the airplane loop, destroying everything on screen (or causing extra damage to bosses, fought at the end of each level). The regular ammo is infinite, while the upgraded weapons have limited ammo. When the weapon button is held down, a bar at the bottom of the screen is charged and a special shot can be released, which varies in effect from weapon to weapon.

The airplane has a life bar which starts with three points. Each hit taken or loop used will consume one life point. The player will earn new life points at the end of levels or by collecting proper power ups. Other power ups available are auxiliary side and ghost airplanes.

But this earlier game has a deeper and more involved plot, blending elements from the Earth’s history with mythology, and speculating a bit into the future.

The battles are quite simple - even slightly less complex than Dragon Quest. But by defeating creatures around you, you gain points you can distribute to four stats. By reaching a certain threshold, you can evolve into an entirely different creature that lived in that era. And this is pretty cool - the evolution tree grows quite expansive as you progress through the Earth’s history.
