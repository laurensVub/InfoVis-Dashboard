The original game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848.
The game is the first entry in the Oregon Trail series, and has since been released in many editions by various developers and publishers who have acquired rights to it, as well as inspiring a number of spinoffs (such as The Yukon Trail and The Amazon Trail) and the parody/homage The Organ Trail.",,,"Commodore / Amiga, Classic Macintosh, Apple II, PC","Adventure, Simulation",Singleplayer,"MECC, Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium","Gameloft, Br√∏derbund, The Learning Company",1971

The game was conceived by Walter Bright starting in 1971, based on various war movies and board games, notably Battle of Britain and Risk. The first version on a computer was released in 1977, and ported to many platforms in the 1970s and 80s. Several commercial versions were also released, often adding basic graphics to the originally text-based user interface. The basic gameplay is strongly reminiscent of several later games, notably Civilization.",,,"Commodore / Amiga, Atari ST, PC",Strategy,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer","Walter Bright, Mark Baldwin, Peter Langston","New World Computing, Killer Bee Software, Interstel",1971

Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.",,,,Arcade,"Space, combat, battle, history, rocket, colors",Syzygy Engineering,Nutting Associates,1971

Created by Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, it was one of the first coin-operated video games; its initial prototype display in November 1971 at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford University was only a few months after a similar display of a prototype of Computer Space, making it the second known video game to charge money to play. Galaxy Game is an expanded version of the 1962 Spacewar!, potentially the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features two spaceships, ""the needle"" and ""the wedge"", engaged in a dogfight while maneuvering in the gravity well of a star.

425207,star-trek-1971,Star Trek (1971),1971-01-01,,3.5,5,0,21,0,0,"Star Trek is a text-based strategy video game based on the Star Trek television series and originally developed by Mike Mayfield in 1971. In the game, the player commands the USS Enterprise on a mission to hunt down and destroy an invading fleet of Klingon warships. The player travels through the 64 quadrants of the galaxy to attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes in turn-based battles and refuel at starbases in order to eliminate all enemies before running out of time.

Mayfield originally wrote the game in the BASIC programming language for the SDS Sigma 7 mainframe computer with the goal of creating a game like Spacewar! (1962) that could be played with a teleprinter instead of a graphical display. He then rewrote it for the HP 2000C minicomputer in 1972, and it was included in Hewlett-Packard's public domain software catalog the following year. It was picked up from there by David H. Ahl, who ported it with Mary Cole to BASIC-PLUS and published the source code in the Digital Equipment Corporation Edu newsletter. It was republished with other computer games in his best-selling 101 BASIC Computer Games book. Bob Leedom then expanded the game in 1974 into Super Star Trek, which was later printed by Ahl in BASIC Computer Games, the first million-selling computer book.

Star Trek, especially the Super Star Trek version, was immensely popular during the early microcomputer era. This, along with the availability of the source code, led to numerous ports of both versions of the game. Additionally, dozens of variants and expansions were made for a variety of systems. Ahl claimed in 1978 that it was difficult to find a computer installation that did not contain a version of Star Trek, and by 1980, Star Trek was described by The Dragon magazine as ""one of the most popular (if not the most popular) computer games around"", with ""literally scores of different versions of this game floating around"".",,,"Linux, PC",Strategy,Text based,,,1971

Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players at the beginning of a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.",,,PC,"Simulation, Sports",,Don Daglow,,1971
