Having no particular plot or story at all, Counter-Strike was a competitive game mostly used as PvP. With new physics and a large amount of weaponry, you can choose between two fractions - Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. Each team had their signature weapon (CTs had M16 while T had AK-47, for example), the main goal of every round was to kill the opposite team or fulfil a task.  In case there is a bomb plant - detonate or prevent, hostages - rescue or prevent from it or assassination. One player from the team is chosen as a VIP person that must be protected, and the goal of the opposite team is to kill this VIP. By winning every round, you received a good payment, by loosing - much lesser one. You can spend cash on buying equipment and weapon.

Richochet is a deathmatch game that closely resembles platformers. The game field is made out of several floating platforms which the players can jump on by stepping on one of the arrows on the edge of the platform.

The objective is to push other players off the platforms using throwing discs - the only weapon present in the game. The player can't have more than 3 discs at the same time. The platforms are limited by a horizontal strip that can be used for ricocheting the discs. For pushing the player off with a direct hit, 1 point is scored. 2 for pushing the player off with a ricochet and 3 for double ricochet.

There are two firing modes: single disc shot and the beheading shot that uses all three discs at once. 

In comparison to other Half-Life mods, the number of deaths is not tracked by in-game statistics. Overall, this mod is much more primitive than the others.

It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.
The game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as ""Active Time Event"" cutscenes, ""Mognet"", and unique equipment and skill systems.

Unmatched battle variety: build fortified bases, blitz the air, storm with armor, engage with naval units, even dig tunnels for surprise attacks.EARTH 2150: ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANETThe 21st century was supposed to herald the dawn of a new age. The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.
In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map.
The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.
The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECTThe year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… ""SUNLIGHT""EARTH 2150: LOST SOULSIt is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist.
Devastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences.
The only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars. Hurry up, cause time is ticking away....",http://www.earth2150.com/,,"PC, macOS",Strategy,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Sci-fi, Classic, Includes level editor, RTS",Reality Pump,"TopWare Interactive, ACE",2000

You’ll also learn to set magical traps containing deadly spell combinations to thwart the unsuspecting foe. Although you’ll have to renounce the use of ungainly swords and armor in the name of your art, you will still be able to wield a staff as a last-ditch physical defense.
If you choose a Conjurer you will be able to magically charm and summon creatures to do your bidding.

About: He who controls the swill controls the universe. It really is that simple.

An untapped supply of swill has just been discovered on the uninhabited archipelago of Saustralasia deep in the South Pigsific Ocean, and every Hog Nation wants the land as its own. Gone are the days of scratching around for drips of swill. Saustralasia’s 25 regions are drenched in the stuff, and the only way to ensure that no one else gets their filthy trotters on the delicious swill is WAR!

Your task will not be an easy one. To successfully conquer and exploit Saustralasia you will need to seek and destroy the enemy across each and every one of the archipelago’s six islands, from Hogshead all the way down to Arstria. Our resources are limited, you have to maintain a rather small army, but with every victory on the field of battle, your swine will learn more skills and acquire the use of a wider range of weaponry.

There will be slaughter and butchery. Your job will be to bring victory to your chosen nation, to save your own bacon and make a meal of your enemies. With victory comes great reward. So great in fact that your brave boars will be as happy as pigs in… well, you get the idea.

The game is set in a fantasy world thousands of years after a battle between Granas, the god of light, and Valmar, the god of darkness, nearly destroyed the planet until Valmar was split into pieces and scattered across the land. In the aftermath of the battle, the Church of Granas has led humanity to prosperity by spreading the word of good, but when a young mercenary named Ryudo is charged to protect a songstress from the church named Elena, their journey reveals that the church's history, as well as the history of the world, is not all it seems.
While the original Dreamcast version of the game received a largely positive response from critics in Japan and the West, its later ports to the PlayStation 2 and PC were typically seen as inferior due to a combination of technical shortcomings and other high-profile games released during the transition.",,,"PC, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2",RPG,Singleplayer,"GAME ARTS, Rocket Studio","Ubisoft Entertainment, Enix, Game Arts",2000

It is the second instalment of the MediEvil series and a sequel to MediEvil. It was first released on 19 April 2000 in Europe and 30 April 2000 in North America. Taking place 500 years after the events of the first game, it follows series' protagonist Sir Daniel Fortesque's revival in Victorian era London as he attempts to stop sorcerer Lord Palethorn and Jack the Ripper's plans to terrorise the city by raising the dead.
Following the positive reception of the first game, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to make a sequel to MediEvil before the end of the PlayStation's lifespan. The original concepts for MediEvil 2 went through many transformations during development before the Cambridge team finally settled on making a sequel set during the Victorian Gothic revival, largely reminiscent of its predecessor. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise including slight improvements over its predecessor, such as artificial intelligence and graphical enhancements, but was criticised for lack of innovation from the original.",,,PlayStation,"Action, Adventure","Singleplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","SCE Cambridge Studio, Guerrilla Cambridge","Sony Computer Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment",2000

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.
The game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.
The World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence.

It is the fifth main installment in the Mega Man X series. It was first released for the PlayStation for Japan in 2000 and in North America and PAL territories the following year.
Mega Man X5 is set in the 22nd century in a world where humans coexist with humanoid androids called ""Reploids"". Daily life is under a constant threat of these Reploids going ""Maverick"" and participating in dangerous and deadly crime. After the events of Mega Man X4, the Maverick leader Sigma has been revived and seeks to unlock the true power of the former Maverick Zero and destroy the hero Mega Man X in the process. To make matters worse, Sigma has set the space colony Eurasia on a 16-hour collision course with Earth. It is up to X and Zero to stop Sigma once again and save the planet from destruction. Like its predecessors, Mega Man X5 is an action-platform game in which the player controls either protagonist through a series of eight, selectable stages and wins the special weapon of each stage's boss. However, the game only offers limited number of stage attempts before the player must deal with the colony.
According to Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mega Man X5 was originally intended to be the final game in the Mega Man X saga. Critical reception for the game was lukewarm, with many reviewers agreeing that the stale gameplay formula will only further satisfy diehard fans of the series.

It is a spiritual sequel to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron released two years earlier. Despite the similarities between the two games, the development team designed a completely new game engine for Battle for Naboo and included land- and water-based combat in addition to aerial combat.
Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, the game takes place during the events depicted in the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Players control Gavyn Sykes, a lieutenant in Naboo's Royal Security Forces. As the game progresses, Sykes and the Royal Security Forces fight the Trade Federation in 15 missions that take place on Naboo or in the space immediately surrounding it. The game concludes after the player completes a mission that recreates the film's climactic assault on the Trade Federation's Droid Control Ship.
Battle for Naboo was published by LucasArts and THQ and released for the Nintendo 64 in December 2000. A Windows port was released three months later in March 2001. The Nintendo 64 version received generally positive reviews; critics praised the game's tight and responsive controls, but expressed dislike for the game's Episode I setting.

The game was intended to be a Dreamcast launch title, however, due to numerous delays it was not released in Europe until November 2000, with a North American version following in January 2001. Development of a Japanese version was started, but was never released.
Metropolis Street Racer is notable for introducing the ""Kudos"" system (whereby players are rewarded for racing stylishly as well as quickly) into video games, and for its detailed and accurate recreations of the cities of London, Tokyo and San Francisco. Music for the game was composed by Richard Jacques, and delivered via nine fictional radio stations (three for each city), similar to the Grand Theft Auto series. The day/night time spectrum during game play is realistic, in that the game uses the internal clock of the Dreamcast to calculate the present time in each city. Play at 8AM in England, for example, and the San Francisco races will all be at night (12 AM).

It was published by Atlus in Japan in 1999, while Sega localized and released the game overseas in 2000. Gameplay has the Maken—a sentient sword-like being—""brainjacking"" or taking control of multiple characters across a variety of levels; combat is primarily based around short-ranged melee attacks, with some characters sporting additional abilities such as ranged attacks.
The story is set on near-future Earth during a time when the world is descending into chaos due to natural disasters and rising political tension between China and the United States. When the facility where the Maken was developed is attacked, the sword bonds to main heroine Kay Sagami and is sent on missions against the group responsible for the attack. Depending on dialogue choices and brainjacked characters, seven possible endings can be achieved.
Concept work began during the middle of production on the Persona 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The game was met with mixed reviews, but sold well in Japan. An enhanced remake for the PlayStation 2, Maken Shao: Demon Sword, was published by Atlus in Japan in 2001 and in Europe by Midas Interactive Entertainment in 2003.

This version features every single course from the original Daytona USA game and the Championship Circuit Edition. Three new tracks were also specially designed for this game ('Rin Rin Rink', 'Circuit Pixie' and 'Mermaid Lake'), and all of the tracks are playable normally, in reverse, mirrored, or in reverse-mirrored mode.
The game's graphics were significantly updated from previous home installments of Daytona USA, more resembling the likes of Daytona USA 2. It was also playable online, allowing for competition between up to four players and uploading/downloading of best times and ghost car information, although the online options were removed from the PAL version. The Dreamcast's online servers for both Alien Front Online and Daytona USA 2001 were taken down permanently by mistake as a result of the developers hard-coding the IP-address to the servers in the game and Sega giving away a network block that belonged to AT&T. Another addition to Daytona USA 2001 was the Championship mode, where the player must place above a certain point in the overall rankings to progress, culminating in the King of Daytona Cup.
This version tends to be criticized for poor controls. The analog stick's default setting is extremely sensitive, but that can be corrected in the options screen (except in the Japanese version). However, the game still does not handle exactly like the original arcade version of Daytona USA even when using a racing wheel. The physics, handling, and control are different from the arcade version. Though it is likely that the game has its game mechanics derived from Shutokō Battle 2, and was designed with analog controls in mind and therefore doesn't play as easily on a joypad as the Sega Saturn versions which used a standard d-pad.",,,Dreamcast,Racing,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","Amusement Vision, GENKI","SEGA, Infogrames, Hasbro Interactive",2000

It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei franchise, and began in 2000 with the Game Boy Color games Black Book and Red Book. Five more role-playing games and three games in other genres were released until 2004, followed by no new releases until the 2011 social game Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children. In addition to the games, the series has been adapted into manga, anime, and a trading card game, and two soundtrack albums have been released by First Smile Entertainment.
The series follows demon-human hybrids called devil children, who journey from Japan to the demon world, and are joined by talking companion monsters who give them guidance. The player takes the role of one such devil child, and battles against demons; the devil children do not fight directly themselves, however, but have allied demons in their party fight for them. The player can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them, to try to make them join the player's party, and can increase their allied demons' power by fusing multiple demons with each other.
While Multimedia Intelligence Transfer developed most of the games in the series, Enterbrain and Index Corporation also developed one game each. The music for the first two games was composed by Tomoyuki Hamada, who made use of both orchestral music and rock. Yuji Himukai, known for his work on the Etrian Odyssey series, worked as character designer and illustrator on the 2011 game, creating new art for returning characters. The series received a wide range of reviews, from negative to positive.

It was originally published by KID on March 23, 2000, for the PlayStation under the name Infinity, and has since been released on multiple platforms. The game is the first title in the Infinity series, and is followed by Ever 17: The Out of Infinity, Remember 11: The Age of Infinity, 12Riven: The Psi-Climinal of Integral, and Code_18.
In the game, the player takes the role of Makoto Ishihara, a college student who attends a seminar camp on an island together with three other students; he also befriends three other people who he meets on the island. The game takes place over the course of a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the female characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to try to prevent the character's death.
The game was directed by Takumi Nakazawa, planned and written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, and composed for by Takeshi Abo. Uchikoshi included science fiction elements in the game, but was unable to make heavy use of use them, as his superiors at KID thought that the game needed to focus on cute female characters in order to sell. Abo composed music based on his first impressions of reading the game's story, with a focus on its ""emotional flow"". Because of the science fiction and theoretical themes, he composed ""geometric music"".
A reviewer at RPGFan praised the game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring. As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually moved away from the dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.",,,"Dreamcast, PC, PSP",Indie,Singleplayer,KID,"CyberFront, KID",2000

For the first time, players can see into the personal lives of the characters in the Monster Rancher world, and interact with them while attempting to win matches of the collectible card game, to collect enough cards to complete quests. Along the way, the player is able to visit various locales and meet up with old friends and new acquaintances.
The card game itself features a tutorial mode, on screen help, and the option to turn animations on or off. It is easy enough at low levels for almost anyone to learn the basics, but offers options and higher levels of complexity to reward more patient, and older players.
Cards are acquired through defeating opponents, and via an in-game shrine where you can use music CDs, PlayStation games, or PC CD-ROMs to make cards. The CD shrining feature is unique to the Monster Rancher games.
The game also features a 2P mode designed for players who have played the game on their own and acquired their own cards (and tried and tested their skills) to play card games against each other.

To do that, his sister wishes for him to take a new maid under his wing so that he can guide and help her grow.

Things not going well? Summon monsters and holy men, or thunder-strike an approaching army. Punish sinners by volcanic eruption, or amaze them by solar eclipse. Game too long? Trigger the Apocalypse, now! Or later.  Just watch out for those formidable heretics, atheists and aliens!
Indie & old-school
Truly independent, home-made strategy game for fans of good old PC games. Call it retro, if you will. Designed, developed and crafted completely by one person. This is a game like your grandma used to make 'em: cute 2D graphics and slow-paced gameplay, which exercises your brain rather than your thumbs.
Oh mighty and pious leader, lead your faithful people to glory and subdue the foes. Game conceptTheocracy is a turn-based strategy game. Players take turns to move their armies, attack the enemies, cast miracles, choose research, decide what to produce in their regions and enact dogmas (commandments). Your goal is to expand your theocracy into a dominant world empire by defeating your opponents. This is achieved by conquest and peaceful conversion of other regions on the map and their incorporation into your own theocracy, and by disruptive divine interventions, which you can trigger - miracles and dogmas.
At the beginning of the game, the ancient, undiscovered world is filled with pagan regions. You and your AI opponents - leaders of other theocracies - all start with one region (the Holy Land), and from there you explore the world, expand your empires and try to defeat each other.  Regions can be conquered by armies, or peacefully converted by impact of Power. Power is a special resource, which radiates from your regions, shrines, holy men and miracles, and impacts its wide surroundings. Power is used to convert tiles and other regions, and as it accumulates, it is used to enact dogmas and cast miracles.
Important achievements in the game are rewarded by Victory Points. The first player to reach 100 Victory Points wins. Victory Points are awarded for percentage of world population following your religion, for number of other players' Holy Lands which you conquered, for enacting the dogmas, creating holy men, discovering sacred mountains and (should it be necessary) invoking the Apocalypse miracle.
This is a humble, indie game, made byte by byte, pixel by pixel, from scratch, without any game engine. The game is done in retro, vintage style, with top-down 2D world based on classical antique maps.
The game avoids tiring complexity and micro-management of dozens of features typical for its larger 4X cousins, and focuses on the action - why waste time building roads and farms, when you can just flood the enemy region?!? A game can be won or lost in a single gaming session.",http://www.atlantis-workshop.com/,,PC,"Strategy, Indie","Singleplayer, Retro, Cute, Historical, Isometric, Medieval, Turn-Based Strategy, Magic, Military, Top-Down, Turn-Based Combat, Illuminati, Alternate History, Grand Strategy, 4X, Mythology, Old School, Wargame, Faith","Philos Laboratories, Marcel Strbak","Ubisoft Entertainment, Atlantis Workshop",2000

In the games, the player contacts various creatures using a mobile phone-like device in order to get them to battle the foes he or she will encounter. Released exclusively in Japan on November 3, 2000, the first game in the series was released for the Game Boy Color in two versions: Power Version (パワーバージョン, Pawā Bājon) and Speed Version (スピードバージョン, Supīdo Bājon). Each version features several exclusive creatures. The name of the series derives from keitai (携帯), the Japanese term for mobile phone, as making phone calls to the creatures is an integral part of the games, and fang, to symbolize the various beasts involved.


On April 26, 2002, a lesser-known sequel for the Game Boy Advance called Keitai Denjū Telefang 2 (携帯電獣テレファング２, Keitai Denjū Terefangu Tsū, lit. ""Mobile Phone Beast Telefang Two"") was released exclusively in Japan. Likewise, two versions were released, also called Power Version (パワーバージョン, Pawā Bājon) and Speed Version (スピードバージョン, Supīdo Bājon), featuring similar differences in between them.

Galatea is my first released foray into interactive fiction. It is a single conversation with a single character, which can end any of a number of ways depending on the player's decisions. Despite its age, I continue to get strong reactions to it in my email inbox on a fairly regular basis. Some people love it; some people find it annoying or distressing. 

Galatea has what I call a multilinear plot: unlike traditional IF, it has no single path to victory. Instead there are a large number of endings, some more satisfactory than others, of which many could be considered ""win"" states. It takes only a few minutes of play to arrive at an ending, but considerably longer to find all of them. 

The game also takes an ambitious approach to NPC (non-player character) conversation, both in terms of volume (Galatea has many hundreds of things to say) and complexity (she keeps track of the state of conversation and reacts differently according to what has already been said and done).",http://pr-if.org/play/galatea/,,"PC, Web",Adventure,"Singleplayer, Sci-fi, Futuristic, Mythology",Emily Short,,2000

The player takes control of a knight, but not the ordinary medieval knight. While the other knights are out on the battlefield, this knight is at home cropping the castle's rosebushes and solving math problems.

The main part of the game is a puzzle game played from a top down perspective where the player has to crop the bushes and collect treasures, while at the same time avoiding getting crushed by enormous metallic balls and running into various meanies, such as vikings, wizards and dark knights.

Between the puzzle levels, the player gets to play four different educational games:
The first is a math game where the player can move the knight left and right and has to pick the correct equations falling from the sky, while avoiding the equations that are wrong.
The second is a word game and is identical to the math game except that here the player has to catch correctly spelled words.
The third game is a memory game where the player has to memorize where in a room different objects are hidden.
The fourth is another math game where the player controls a hot air balloon and has to collect bubbles. Each bubble has a value and the player has to collect the right sum.

The game can be played solo or in a tournament mode against up to seven other players. There is also a practice mode where each game can be played on its own.",,,PC,"Educational, Puzzle","Fantasy, Medieval, Top-Down, Real-Time, Math",,,2000

734645,zelda-classic,Zelda Classic,2000-04-16,,0.0,1,0,5,0,0,"Zelda Classic is a tribute to (what we think is) the greatest video game of all time: Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda. It has been developed into an exact replica of the NES version that we all know and love. Beyond that, Zelda Classic allows the development of new quests that can use either the traditional graphics or enhanced graphics, as well as new enemies, items, and challenges.

Though it started as a basic Legend of Zelda clone by programmer Phantom Menace in April of 1999, Zelda Classic has grown into something much bigger in the past few years. A full LOZ replica was achieved by June of 2000, with Zelda Classic version 1.84, but the story didn’t end there. Although Phantom Menace moved on to other projects, Fans of Zelda Classic wanted more.

Fast forward to after about a year of searching for a new programmer, when Dark Nation comes to Armageddon Games, and breathes new life into what seemed like a dying beast. Within weeks, a new version of Zelda Classic is released, and it’s popularity soars. Zelda Classic 1.90, introduced a list of new features, and with it’s addition to Download.com, Armageddon Games is flooded with about 3000+ new members, and over a million downloads in a matter of months!

Zelda Classic has since been released as open source and has current stable ports on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Development continues to this day with new features still being added. Check back often to see what’s new!",https://www.zeldaclassic.com/,,PC,Adventure,"modding, freeware, Fangame",,,2000

The game retailed for the low price of $9.99, a response by Take-Two to the recent decision of Sony to drop PlayStation licensing fees. Similar to the earlier PlayStation title Twisted Metal, players control a powerful tank-like armored vehicle, which they used to destroy enemy vehicles, weapons, and generators, solve puzzles, and collect tokens to upgrade their weapons. There are a total of twenty-three missions, and the game allows two players to battle each other in split screen multiplayer.
Upon its release, Grudge Warriors was received unfavorably; critics bashed the game as having mediocre graphics, poor sounds, and botched gameplay. IGN and Gaming Age declared the game was not even worth the low price of ten dollars. Despite the overwhelmingly critical reception, there were a few points of the game that were praised, including the occasional puzzles during missions.",,,PlayStation,"Shooter, Racing","Singleplayer, Split Screen, exclusive, true exclusive",Tempest Software,Take Two Interactive,2000

It was the first game in the modern series to be featured on the Dreamcast, and was the spiritual successor to World Series Baseball for the Sega Genesis. It was released in July 2000 to coincide with the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Atlanta.
World Series Baseball 2K1 featured a cutting-edge graphical presentation adapted from the NAOMI game Super Major League, and its visuals were well ahead of any other baseball game at the time. Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that WSB2K1 was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to WSB2K1's release—isn't even an option available to players.
After the debacle that was World Series Baseball 2K1, Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful NBA 2K and NFL 2K series) in for the next version of the game. The result was World Series Baseball 2K2, a game that was considered a major improvement over WSB2K1.",,,Dreamcast,Sports,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","SEGA, Wow Entertainment",SEGA,2000

In the Piano room at Greveholm the duke is trying to play ""The old castle song,"" but his sheet of music with the song is missing.

Jean is punished for his mistake and the princess decides to help him and locate all the portraits. To start she will need the help of Sprak, who will provide her with useful items for her quest.

Unlike the sequel, this installment uses a similar interface as the original game. Gameplay is a bit easier. The first episode of the game plays in the Piano room, where the player has to solve a number of puzzles, including various sound puzzles. This episode assumes that you are already familiar with the rooms in the castle, which you explored in the first game.
