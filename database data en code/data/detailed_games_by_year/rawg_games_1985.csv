AMFV was not a conventional Infocom adventure, having only a single puzzle near the end of the game. Unlike most other Infocom titles, particularly those written by Steve Meretzky, the game had a serious tone and a political theme, attributes which the company would revisit with the following year's Trinity. The game is among Infocom's most respected titles, although it was not a commercial success. It was also the first of the ""Interactive Fiction Plus"" line, meaning that AMFV had greater memory requirements, unlike earlier Infocom games that used a less advanced version of the company's Z-machine interpreter. It is Infocom's seventeenth game.

Meier collaborated with Air Force pilot John W. “Bill” Stealy to ensure the game’s accuracy. F-15 Strike Eagle marries authentic combat simulation with arcade action for an incredibly satisfying experience.
Using your arsenal of missiles, bombs, and cannons to take out a variety of ground targets, if you can survive air-to-air combat from enemy fighters. Choose from seven missions, including strikes in Libya, Egypt, Iran and above the Persian Gulf in the Middle East, and strikes in Haiphong and Hanoi in Vietnam.

It was also ported to the Tatung Einstein home computer in 1989, exclusively in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth instalment of the Strategic Wargames series.
The game is set during a fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, in which both sides use nuclear and chemical weapons against each other. The main objective of the game is to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.
During development, the developers obtained extensive information and statistics of military strength from the Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. Theatre Europe gained national controversy upon release, receiving criticism from both the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and The Sun newspaper. Some high street retail chains refused to sell the game upon release. Despite the controversy, the game received critical acclaim from reviewers.

It stars a young boy who is armed with a gun. Each level is an infinitely-repeating maze with several dice. Each die is filled with monsters which hatch out and the player must shoot to shrink, then collect them. If the player does not collect each shrunken monster quickly, it turns into a time-eating bug which flies to the time limit bar and consumes a chunk of it. If you touch one monster or run out of time then you lose a life. The game ends if all lives are lost. There are 50 distinct levels, called ""rounds"" in the game, even though the counter goes to 99 (the 100th level does not show). The player can play through the levels loops infinitely, with no apparent end. There are also ""bonus rounds"" every so often where the player can shoot colored dice to reveal prizes and increase his or her score.
The name of the arcade version was a reference to a 1985 hit song entitled ""Teddy Boy Blues"" by then-popular Japanese pop star Yōko Ishino, an instrumental version of which constantly played in the background during the game.

Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many, many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by those who are in the know to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.
Because 1985's newly released NES game console is internally compatible with 1983's Famicom game console, all Stack-Up GamePak cartridges contain the 60-pin circuit board of a Famicom cartridge, attached to a 72-pin adapter like the T89 Cartridge Converter for the NES.

The detective-style gameplay resembles contemporary menu-driven adventures such as The Vera Cruz Affair, and later titles such as Yes, Prime Minister and Floor 13.
The game was released in 1985 by Hutchinson Computer Publishing, a subsidiary of the publishing house Hutchinson. It was designed by John Lambshead and Gordon Paterson, and the programming was by Ben Notarianni, Rupert Bowater and Paul Norris of the Electronic Pencil Company.[1] The game was released for the ZX Spectrum in July 1985, with the Commodore 64 release following one month later, and the Amstrad CPC conversion in 1986. The game was split into three parts, and large sections of the programming was outsourced to others: Andrew Glaister (program conversion Spectrum, parts one and two), Dave Jones (programming Spectrum, part three), Ray Owen (graphics Spectrum, part three) and John Gibbons (programming C64, part three). The IBM PC version was developed for the Electronic Pencil company, by a developer named Brian Mallett. The PC version was written in 8086 assembler and used CGA graphics in 4 colour mode. The PC version was ported from the Z80 and 6502 versions. The PC version did not use DOS but booted up from its own floppy disk.
The game comprises three sections - The NATO Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. In order to get into the last two the player must solve a riddle which is derived in the previous section. Macintosh-like icons were used to assign watchers and navigate and finally text-based interaction was in the third section.",,,Commodore / Amiga,,Singleplayer,Electronic Pencil Company,Ariolasoft,1985

Afterwards, the player can venture into the depths of BIAS, which is a huge maze-like dungeon. Enemies attack randomly; however, instead of the usual turn-based battle screen, the hero and the enemy are taken to a small side-scrolling area.
