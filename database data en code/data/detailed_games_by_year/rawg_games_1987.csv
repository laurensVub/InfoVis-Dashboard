The second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System on January 14, 1987, less than a year after the original The Legend of Zelda was released and seven months before North America saw the release of the first Zelda title. The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1988, almost two years after its initial release in Japan.
The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor. As of 2016, the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.
The game was a critical and financial success, and introduced elements such as Link's ""magic meter"" and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements, such as experience points, and the platform-style side-scrolling and limited lives have not been used since in canonical games.

Originally released for the NES, Final Fantasy was remade for several video game consoles and is frequently packaged with Final Fantasy II in video game collections. The story follows four youths called the Light Warriors, who each carry one of their world's four elemental orbs which have been darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. Together, they quest to defeat these evil forces, restore light to the orbs, and save their world.
Final Fantasy was originally conceived under the working title Fighting Fantasy, but trademark issues and dire circumstances surrounding Square as well as Sakaguchi himself prompted the name to be changed. The game was a great commercial success, received generally positive reviews, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the Final Fantasy series. The original is now regarded as one of the most influential and successful role-playing games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, playing a major role in popularizing the genre.

The game begins the struggle of the humanoid robot and player-character Mega Man against the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six Robot Masters under his control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a ""Robot Master"" boss battle that awards the player-character a unique weapon.
Critics praised Mega Man for its overall design, though the game was not a commercial success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs.

Enix's U.S. subsidiary published the American version of Dragon Quest II for the Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES) in 1990. Dragon Quest II is set one hundred years after the events of the first game.
The game's story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins, the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. Dragon Quest II greatly expands on the series formula from the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship. The game's successor, Dragon Quest III: And Into the Legend..., follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero Erdrick; and the three games are collectively called ""Erdrick Saga Trilogy"".
Planning began a month before the original Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used as the basis for the characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.
Dragon Quest II was successful in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped 2.4 million copies. Later, the game was remade for the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color and combined with the original Dragon Quest game in a release entitled Dragon Quest I & II. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on June 26, 2014 and worldwide on October 9, 2014, as Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line. The game was praised for improving on almost all aspects of the original, including having better graphics, having a larger world to explore, and more characters to participate in a more dynamic combat system. It was also known as one of the most difficult Dragon Quest games, especially late game, and retained that reputation despite adjustments made when it was ported to other platforms.",,,"Nintendo Switch, Game Boy Color, NES",RPG,Singleplayer,Chunsoft,Enix,1987

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed.

Faxanadu is a spin-off or side-story of Xanadu, which is the second installment of Falcom's long-running RPG series, Dragon Slayer. The title Faxanadu is a portmanteau formed from the names Famicom and Xanadu.
The game follows the story of an unnamed traveler who returns to his home town, which is part of a massive inhabited tree, only to find it ruined and abandoned because the tree's water source has stopped and is tasked with finding out the cause and saving the tree.
The game uses typical sidecrolling and platforming gameplay. However, the game also employs various elements that classify it as a role-playing video game including its expansive story and medieval setting. Along with that, the game has graphics that were unique compared to other games at the time. The game was relatively unknown and fell below the radar of many gamers at the time of its release.

Instead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured Michael Van Wijk (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series Gladiators) as the hero and bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian's profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour.

Welcome to the re-release of Airborne Ranger, one of Microprose's most critically acclaimed war games.
At the start of each mission you go through a proper pre-combat briefing session, and then select a Ranger from your company that has what you think are the right skills for the job ahead. You start each mission by piloting the brand new V-22 Osprey and picking locations to drop three ammo crates deep in enemy territory (Airborne Ranger was released in 1988, the Osprey first came into active service in 1989, so this is some real black ops business). Each supply crate contains ammunition, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades & LAW rockets depending on your briefing. Choose locations wisely: you can only carry so much ammo, so resupply is critical.
Then parachute behind enemy lines and get to work. .. and this is no easy drop, you will need to steer your parafoil to a safe landing. Missions range from destroying military targets and  sabotaging installations, to rescuing POWs and stealing secrets. You’ll need to navigate enemy troops and officers, minefields, foxholes and bunkers. Switch between stealth and surgically accurate combat to succeed. At times you might even need to steal an enemy uniform. And you better get back to the LZ for exfil in time, or you will get captured. If you get captured, welcome to your next mission – you are going to need to mount a rescue attempt before you can complete the primary objective.
Understanding the environment is critical to success. In the arctic missions you can lure enemies onto unstable ice, in the jungles and forests you can hide under water. Do you use your knife? Your M4? Or a delayed time bomb? Sprint across the open field, or crawl in a trench to avoid detection? It is all up to you.
Practice mode lets you try individual missions, and then step up to Veteran mode and you will have to complete all 12 missions as a campaign. You’ll rank up with each successful mission, all the way to a full colonel in the U.S. Airborne Rangers.
Twelve missions, winter, desert and jungle terrains, and four difficulty modes will keep you playing again and again.
A mix of strategy and arcade action
An accurate 80s menu of weapons
Choose from your squadron of Rangers for every mission

Players assume the role of Jack the WorldRunner, a wild ""space cowboy"" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts.

It was also notable for being one of the first stereoscopic 3-D games.

At first Nakajima intended to use the software to gain revenge on a classmate who bullied him. However, things went out of control, and the malicious demon Loki was unleashed into the world. Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover the truth about their own previous incarnations.

Based on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing franchise. The game is a first-person RPG with turn-based combat, set entirely in large, maze-like dungeon areas. Unlike in most Japanese-style RPGs, the player can manually increase combat parameters of Nakajima and Yumiko when they gain a level.

The game introduces the demon summoning feature that has since become the distinguishing gameplay element of the series. The player is able to communicate with randomly encountered demons through Nakajima's computer software, summon them, and make them fight as members of the controlled party. Communications with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon.

Phantasie III: The Wrath of Nikademus is much more than a sequel to the bestselling Phantasie™ and Phantasie II™. It is a fantasy adventure game far greater in scope, complexity, and challenge.
This time, the Dark Lord Nikademus has set his evil sights on conquering — not only an island — but the entire world!

He must be stopped, and you've been chosen to undertake this difficult and dangerous quest. Assemble and guide a band of six brave souls (human and other-wise) to search for and destroy Nikademus.

Your group will traverse an entire continent, battling the Dark Lord's ugly hordes and exploring dungeons for clues that will ultimately lead you to Nikademus — and to the Final Confrontation.
Travel to the astral Planes of Light and Darkness where you will meet some of the most powerful beings that inhabit the Phantasie Universe — including the legendary Lord Wood. From these encounters, you hope to gain the knowledge and power with which to destroy the Dark Lord.

This pivotal game boasts a number of new and improved features. Bows and arrows and ever more potent spells have been added to the long list of weapons. During combat, you can move each character to the front, middle, or back of the party. You can also aim your spells at different ranks of the enemy. You determine which skills an individual character should improve on as he gains experience. Wounds are specified by body location and extent of injury.

You'll enjoy the enhanced graphics display of characters and monsters, and the increased speed of play as you travel across the wilderness and dungeons.

If you've played either Phantasie or Phantasie II, you can use the same set of characters in this game. Of course, you are always free to create new characters.

Judged as either a sequel to one of the most successful fantasy series or as a complete game in its own right, The Wrath of Nikademus promises a spell-binding storyline with enough twists and turns to satisfy your wildest fantasies!",,,"PC, Atari ST, Apple II, Commodore / Amiga","Adventure, RPG","RPG, Fantasy, role-playing, Turn-Based, Magic, Top-Down, evil, quest, spells, dwarves, elves, wizardry, danger, combat-focused, phantasie, character-import, importable-characters","Strategic Simulations, Westwood Associates","Strategic Simulations, StarCraft, Quest/BothTec",1987

The original MIDI Maze team consisted of James Yee as the business manager, Michael Park as the graphics and distributed processing guru, and George Miller writing the AI/drone logic. The game constructed multiplayer networks using the MIDI interface. It has been suggested that MIDI Maze introduced the concept of deathmatch combat.
Up to 16 computers could be networked in a ""MIDI Ring"" by connecting one computer's MIDI-OUT port to the next computer's MIDI-IN port. Unless the computers were looped correctly, more than 4 players tended to slow down the game to a crawl and make it unstable.
Graphically the game was very simple with a humorous twist. The game area itself occupied only roughly a quarter of the screen and consisted of a first-person view of a flat-shaded Pac-Man-like maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players were shown as Pac-Man-like smiley avatars in various colors. Bullets were represented as small balls.
The game was started by one designated ""master"" machine, which set rules, divided players into teams, and selected a maze. A number of mazes were supplied with the game, and additional mazes could be constructed using a simple text-editor or one of various third-party tools. The game was very popular at gatherings of Atari ST users until the end of the Atari ST era, circa 1993.
A prototype of MIDI Maze was found for the Atari 8-bit family. It is possible to connect ST and 8-bit to a network and play together.

The player's mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to your base. This is while simultaneously trying not to get shot by the other team, run out of ammo, or run out of time. A light gun is necessary for this game, but one needs to also use the controller. The directional pad will move the screen left and right. Ammo boxes can be found sitting on the ground or carried by enemies in the background. It seems that only misses cost you ammo, so if one's aim is precise, they will receive a significant bonus for leftover ammunition.
There are three levels in the game: Woods, Warehouse District and Snow Fields. The Woods and Snow Fields levels feature enemies in military garb, while the Warehouse District features enemies modeled after early 1980s punks.

The player controls a spaceship and gains power-up points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game music or in-game sound effects.

It is set in the 1920s and early 1930s in which the player is the pilot of a small airplane. The player's goal is to increase the score by flying the airplane through several races and special events. The player's aircraft is modelled on the Granville Brothers Gee Bee Super Sportster Model Z, a ""flying engine"" which was the predecessor of the more famous, and even more extreme, Model R.
This game is single-player only and has three difficulty levels, which the player must choose between before beginning play. The player's airplane is always yellow, and the races follow a pattern of three main events and one special event, which alternates between popping 30 balloons and flying to the right of red pylons and to the left of blue ones.
One main obstacle is avoiding collision with other aircraft. After two collisions, the plane will falter and the player's pilot is parachuted out. The player hears the sound of a parachute opening and sees an animation sequence of the pilot drifting to the ground. This is followed by one of several amusing pictures depicting the pilot in various landing places, such as a pigpen, a parched desert, a tree, or a barnyard of chickens, for example.
Following successful completion of the special event, a picture of the pilot at an awards ceremony is shown, accompanied by period music. A photographer may be seen photographing the pilot.",,,Commodore / Amiga,Racing,Singleplayer,,Activision Blizzard,1987

It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split-screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The game mechanics were copied into other games too, like the Game Boy game ""Motocross Maniacs"".
The basic premise of the game is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, ""hopping"" and ""wheelies"" to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres.
The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128, one of the few native mode game titles for that computer.
Some obstacles only allowed travel across them in certain ways. For instance, fences and wooden beams can only be navigated at low speed, without ""hopping"" or falling onto them. Tyres would only allow travel at high speeds, driving slowly will ""throw"" the rider. When a rider lands badly (i.e. with the front wheel first) or ""falls off"" an obstacle, they are catapulted a certain distance forward, imposing a certain time penalty because the player is not put back into the game until the screen has scrolled to a ""safe"" (i.e. flat) area of the course on which to restart the bike.
Players can either play against their opponent in a straight-out race to the finish post, or they can ""win"" by aggregated finishing times. Courses are played in sets of five, denoted by a letter of the alphabet and can be edited by the player using the built-in course designer. This allowed the user to place any obstacles on a blank track and later save and share completed courses.",,,Commodore / Amiga,Racing,"Singleplayer, 2 players",Mr. Chip Software,Mastertronic,1987

In this game, the player assumed the role of a Los Angeles police officer fighting rioters. In each level, the player would move toward the top of the screen avoiding or shooting the rioters, who would either lob grenades if at a distance, or beat your character to the pavement with clubs if in melee range.
At the end of each level, a procession of gang members (usually with a single shirt color, marching in formation) would stream down from the top of the screen. After killing all of these gang members, a single gang member would move randomly around the screen with a woman next to him. This functioned a bit like a sharpshooting competition, as shooting the woman would cause the player to lose points, while successfully shooting only the ganger would cause her to ""take the arm"" of your character.
As the levels progress, the gangers become more frequent and the player will begin to see cars placed perpendicular to the street, acting as roadblocks.

The few battles he directed had been won without much test of his mettle. But on the dawn of that fateful Sunday, he found the 45,000 men under his command pressed against the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing, caught in a surprise attack by Confederate General Johnston and his Army of the Mississippi. 

Thus began the Battle of Shiloh, two murderous days that would be Grant's first real trial by fire.

###FOR ALL CIVIL WAR FANS
This superb simulation contains three games that are designed to challenge all Civil War fans — regardless of wargaming experience.
The Introductory Game uses simplified rules and options and easy-to-use joystick control to let the novice player jump right into the action.
The Intermediate Game serves as a stepping stone to the Advanced Game, where complex decisions and intricate rules create an incredibly detailed and realistic simulation that will satisfy even the most veteran of wargamers.

###AWARD WINNING GAME SYSTEM
This game uses an improved version of the critically acclaimed game system first seen in SSI's GETTYSBURG: The Turning Point.™ The Battle of Shiloh is faithfully re-created in 15 turns. All brigades historically present at the battle are included, as are the Federal gunboats Lexington and Tyler. The 30x30 square-grid battlefield (also provided as a 4-color mapcard) accurately reflects the terrain around Shiloh.
A significant refinement is the ability to switch between a strategic and tactical display anytime during play. Another is the inclusion of special morale rules for ""green,"" untried troops.
Generals Grant and Johnston actually appear in the game as army/corps commanders. They can be injured — or killed (as Johnston was in the real battle).
During solitaire play, the computer can direct either or both sides.

###HISTORY REPEATED OR REVISED?
The Battle of Shiloh was a see-saw affair that could easily have been a Union defeat or victory. Now, you determine the outcome of Grant's fearsome trial — and his destiny.",,,"PC, Atari 8-bit, Apple II, Commodore / Amiga",Strategy,,Strategic Simulations,Strategic Simulations,1987

...a war that changed the history of the world!


SONS OF LIBERTY marks SSI's foray into the Revolutionary War. Using our considerable talents in wargaming, we've faithfully re-created the look and feel of that historic conflict, where splendidly dressed British redcoats fought upstart rebels in stiff lines and columns.

Three epic battles make up this game, each increasing in complexity and scale. And each battle can be fought under Introductory, Intermediate or Advanced rules. In solitaire play, the computer can direct either or both sides.

The Battle of Bunker Hill serves as an apt entrance to the game, just as it served as the first major battle of the American Revolution. This critical engagement was a small affair, involving only a few thousand men and a tiny patch of ground. Even under Advanced rules, this scenario can be savored quickly.

The Battle of Monmouth pitted George Washington's winter-hardened veterans against the British in what proved to be a battle of indecisive outcome. What it did show was Washington's leadership, an admirable ability to keep his army together and its morale up against the adversities of weather and war. Can you do as well?

The Battle of Saratoga - the largest of the three - is regarded as the turning point of the Revolution. The rigid formation of the British proved highly unsuited for the heavily wooded terrain, which favored the Colonial's more flexible run-and-shoot style. Historically the British lost, and her defeat convinced France that it was an opportune time to declare war on England, forcing her to fight on two fronts. Will you be able to repeat the outcome?

After all, you’ll be busy flying your Gizmo DHX-1 Attack Chopper behind enemy lines in search of the Mad Leader’s new headquarters. Once there, you’ll begin an all-new series of ground missions to thwart the Mad Leader’s revitalizing troops. But be careful! This time, the Mad Leader knows who he’s up against!",,,PC,,"enemy, attack, baby, helicopter",Gray Matter,Throwback Entertainment,1987
