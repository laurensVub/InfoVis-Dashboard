ADOM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery) is one of the most successful roguelike games ever created, boasting a brilliant mix of story, RPG, exploration, and intensely strategic and flexible combat. The Steam version adds various Deluxe features like achievements, difficulty level customization and various play modes (e.g. a story mode allowing to save and restore games, a weekly challenge game, an exploration mode and more). ADOM has been in development since 1994. In 2012 its development was revitalized with an immensely successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, now allowing us to offer ADOM both with ASCII and graphical modes enabling you to choose freely.
ADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world:
a huge game world with hundreds of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, elemental temples, graveyards, ancient ruins, towers and other secrets
loads of races (dwarves, drakelings, mist elves, hurthlings, orcs, trolls, ratlings and many others) and even more classes (fighters, elementalists, assassins, chaos knights, duelists and much more) allowing for infinite play styles
hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features
a corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation (corruptions slowly transform you into a vile monster but at the same time grant inhuman benefits - most of the time)
spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, crafting and more
dozens of quests and branching story lines
numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself (simply drive Chaos away or slay a god or even become an immortal yourself, and others more)!
various game modes (story mode to be able to load and save games, challenge mode to face peculiar weekly challenges, exploration mode for a free wand of wishing and more)
various customization options (turning hunger off, turning corruption off, modifying monster difficulty or treasure rates)ABOUT THE ANCIENT DOMAINS OF MYSTERY
Deep in the mountainous ranges of the Drakalor Chain, Chaos has broken through into Ancardia and it's up to you to decide the fate of the entire realm. You control a single character with a wildy varying set of skills, talents, spells and other abilities. Customized equipment makes each race/class combination a very different experience. Explore a mostly randomized underworld, fight monsters, loot treasures and uncover the many secrets lurking in the world of Ancardia.
Join a generation of gamers in playing a remastered version of this classic rogue-like!
With an overhaul of the graphics, music, new playable races and classes, over 400 monsters, tens of thousands of items, crafting, magic, religion, corruption, randomized dungeons and so much more, this reimagined version is one of the most in-depth roguelikes on the planet.
So, come join us as we return to Ancardia and choose your fate.ABOUT ADOM ON STEAM
ADOM on Steam will take ADOM gameplay to the next level by introducing the following features (among others) in the next couple of months:
70+ achievements,
game customization features (e.g. turning corruption off, increasing treasure rates adjusting monster lethality),
ghost creation and exchange between players - be haunted by dead player characters and try to win their treasures,
story mode - save and reload your games,
exploration mode - use a wand of wishes to discover completely new sides of the game,
challenge mode - try to score highest under complex conditions in weekly challenge games,
shared and global highscores (TBD),
point-based character generation (TBD),
star sign selection (TBD),
cloud based save files and so much more (TBD).THE FUTURE OF ADOM
Is ADOM a complete game? Yes, a very complete game. A multitude of endings, varied approaches to game play, thousands of starting combinations and an extensive storyline filled with endless details makes for an extremely satisfying experience that justly positions ADOM as one of the big five foundational roguelike games.
Is ADOM a finished game? No. As long as there is interest in the game we will continue to evolve and enhance it. In this respect ADOM differs from many other games on Steam in the best tradition of roguelike classics: We will continue to add both UI enhancements and new content to the core game in order to make it the most complete RPG ever.

Only a single Metroid larva remained. Samus took it to a galactic research station, and scientists assured her that the powers of the larva can be harnessed to help people. However, everything goes wrong when a dragon kills the scientists, takes away the larva, and destroys the research facility. Samus follows the dragon to the planet of Zebes, where she fought Mother Brain before. She must explore the dangerous planet, stay alive, and figure out a way to retrieve the larva.

Super Metroid is a platform game and a follow-up to Metroid II. Like the previous games in the series, it is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game.

There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling).

There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo.",https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/AFZxlJ-lH5fU_h4Q79V3dOpdT9k4EU1N,,"Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, Wii, SNES","Action, Shooter, Adventure, Platformer",Singleplayer,"Nintendo, Intelligent Systems",Nintendo,1994

The fourth main game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, it was released for the Sega Genesis worldwide in February 1994, and in Japan three months later. Following the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Dr. Robotnik's spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island. There, Sonic and Tails must once more retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to stop Death Egg from relaunching, while making rounds with the island's guardian, Knuckles the Echidna.
Development of the game began shortly after the release of Sonic 2 in late 1992. It was developed simultaneously with Sonic & Knuckles; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split them in two projects. The Sonic & Knuckles cartridge features ""lock-on"" technology that allows it to be physically attached to the Sonic 3 cartridge, creating a combined game, Sonic 3 & Knuckles. A portion of the soundtrack was allegedly composed by American pop musician Michael Jackson, who left the project before completion and went uncredited.
As with its two predecessors, Sonic 3 was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States; though this makes it one of the best-selling Genesis games, its predecessors, bundled with the Genesis in some regions, had sold a combined 21 million. The game has been re-released in compilations and download releases for various platforms, including Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.",,,"Wii, Genesis, Xbox 360, PC, GameCube",Arcade,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, cooperative","SEGA, Sonic Team, Backbone Entertainment",SEGA,1994

Killer Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced ""auto-doubles"", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are ""combo breakers"", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.

The hapless soldiers from the first game have been kidnapped by damn, dirty aliens, to see if they can save their own world from invasion. These aliens possess a time machine capable of transporting our not-quite-valiant troops to any period in human history, and they’re going to use it to test the chaps’ abilities in battle. Fortunately, for our boys in uniform, there’s an alien who sympathizes with their plight. He doesn’t agree with how the soldiers are treated and ensures that the ammo is plentiful. Only through the sheer will to live while remaining unventilated can our soldiers survive the grueling 72 stages and return to their own time, in one piece, mind you. Through five different time zones, they’ve got to battle against increasingly remote odds and kick their kidnapper’s butts. Only then can they retire to a place where the sun’s always shining and they serve drinks with those little umbrellas in them.
Guide your stalwart troopers through time as they try to get through this war intact. Blending a perfect mix of action and small-scale strategy, Cannon Fodder 2 is simple yet very, very addictive. Capture vehicles such as the Choppa, the Jeep, and the Tank. Man any turrets you find while on the field of battle and turn the enemy’s weapons against them. Will you bring our boys back home?

It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1994 in Japan, and has since been ported to multiple platforms. It is the second game in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which is a subset of the larger Megami Tensei franchise.
The gameplay comprises first-person exploration of dungeons and battles against demons; the player can also choose to speak to the demons, and attempt to recruit them to their party. By fusing multiple allied demons together, the player can create more powerful demons. The story is set decades after the first Shin Megami Tensei, in the encapsulated city Tokyo Millennium, which is ruled by the religious Messians from a unit called the Center. The player takes the role of a gladiator who is told that he is the Messiah, and is sent on missions around Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare for the Thousand-Year Kingdom. The plot is influenced by choices the player makes throughout the game, determining their moral alignment.
The game was created to not have direct connections to the first Shin Megami Tensei, to ensure that it was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei's future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.",,,"Wii U, Game Boy Advance, iOS, Wii, PlayStation, SNES",RPG,Singleplayer,Atlus,Atlus,1994

The player controls either Annie or Clint sidestepping and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots in the background and dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games.
Development lasted five months on a small budget with a team of only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had previously worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay and artistic design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and sound design drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting.
Wild Guns received positive reviews at its initial release, and in retrospective reviews is considered a cult classic. Critics have praised the gameplay of what has become a niche genre, as well as the cooperative mode and graphical attention to detail. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014.

The game was originally released in December 1994 in Japan, and later in North America in September 1995 by Working Designs. Eternal Blue expanded the story and gameplay of its predecessor, and made more use of the Sega CD's hardware, including more detailed graphics, longer, more elaborate animated cutscenes, and more extensive use of voice acting. Critics were mostly pleased with the title, giving particular merit to the game's English translation and further expansion of the role-playing game genre in CD format.
Set one thousand years after the events of The Silver Star, the game follows the adventure of Hiro, a young explorer and adventurer who meets Lucia, visitor from the far-away Blue Star, becoming entangled in her mission to stop Zophar, an evil, all-powerful being, from destroying the world. During their journey across the world of Lunar, Hiro and Lucia are joined by an ever-expanding cast of supporting characters, including some from its predecessor.

""Book 1"" is a retelling of the events of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light: Marth, the prince of Altea, is forced into exile when his homeland is attacked by the neighboring kingdom of Gra. With his father killed and his sister Elice captive, Marth must muster a force to defeat the will driving the invasion: the dark dragon Medeus and his subordinate Gharnef. Marth's allies include the princess and Pegasus knight Caeda, Marth's mentor Jagen, kindly Princess Nyna of Archanea's Royal Family, and the Archsage Gotoh. His quest leads him to recovering Falchion, a magical sword which can defeat Medeus and which only Marth can wield due to his ancient heritage as a descendant of Anri, the warrior who defeated Medeus. Having recovered both Falchion and the magical Fire Emblem shield, Marth confronts Gharnef and Medeus, the latter of whom is leader of the last surviving tribe of Manakete, an ancient tribe which could shapeshift into dragons. In the end, Marth defeats Medeus and restores peace, surrendering the Fire Emblem to Archanea for safekeeping.

""Book 2"" takes place two years after Book 1. Marth's ally Hardin, now the new Emperor of Archanea, begins the forceful military occupation of neighboring countries, with Marth's army being used as part of the conquests. When Marth grows suspicious of his role in Hardin's plans, he is branded as a traitor to Archanea and is relentlessly hunted down by Hardin's forces. Receiving the Fire Emblem from Nyna by way of a courier, Marth and his army escapes to the desert of Khadein and meets with Gotoh. He explains that Hardin has become possessed by the evil power of the Darksphere, which Gharnef secretly gave to him, and that only the Lightsphere can counter its power and save Hardin. Marth also locates other magical spheres in his quest: the Lifesphere, the Geosphere, and the Starsphere (the latter of which must be reassembled through the collection of Starshards). Marth and his allies journey through the icy mountains to obtain the Lightsphere, then stage a final assault on Archanea to liberate the continent from Hardin's madness. Though the Lightsphere nullifies the Darksphere's power, Hardin is critically wounded in his battle and can only apologize to Marth for his actions before he dies. With the last sphere, Marth inserts all five into the Fire Emblem and unlocks its full power as the Shield of Seals.

Gotoh then arrives to inform Marth that Gharnef has kidnapped several female clerics, including Princess Nyna and his own sister Elice, to serve as sacrifices for the revival of Medeus. Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken the form of an enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.",,,"Nintendo DS, SNES",Strategy,"Dark, Mystery, battle, Dragons, collection, fire, sword, ancient, princess, desert",Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,1994

Different viewing and playback options make it possible to experience every grueling twist, turn and obstacle in your path from varied camera angles and positions, with independent controls for each window in multiplayer modes.
Advanced artificial intelligence gives the game s cars the ability to adapt to the player s performance. The better you are, the better they perform, providing unlimited challenge even for the most seasoned racer.

Each character wields special weapons ranging from towels to the ability to fly, and each also has a special musical theme reflecting his or her personality.
For maximum variety and challenge, the game offers multiple race options ranging from one-lap sudden death races to endurance contests up to 80 laps, plus a choice of four different gameplay modes. These include a practice option where players can test their skills against any driver; a basic Head-to-Head mode for two players racing on one selected track; a Championship mode that allows players to design their own race, mixing tracks and difficulty levels if desired; and a Rumble mode that lets you knock your opponents out of the ring.
Speeds of up to 30 frames per second on the DX266 and up to 60 frames per second on Pentium machines offer exceptional detail, even in four-player mode. There are also 10 different fast starts for players to explore and built-in fast laps on each track for drivers to beat.
The game is also packed with special surprises, including hidden tracks and characters, and bonus points that make it possible to win a race without finishing in first place. Players receive extra points for causing damage to other cars and for finishing a race damage-free. Cars that incur damage are penalized with slower performance.

Released in Japan as Super Drakkhen (スーパードラッケン) and otherwise known as Drakkhen II, it is meant to be a sequel to Drakkhen although it bears little resemblance to its predecessor. It uses the same pseudo-3D overworld system for which the series is most famous. Other features of Dragon View are its side-view action role-playing game (RPG) hybrid gameplay (used when exploring more detailed areas such as towns and dungeons), its well translated first person storyline, and its emphasis on player-driven undirected exploration.
The Drakkhen series' most recognizable feature is its custom overworld engine. First used by the original Amiga version of Drakkhen, it was later used in the PC and SNES ports. The Dragon View version sports basic terrain shading and mountainlike ""boundaries"" that enclose areas of the continent. While not ""True 3D"", the overworld engine simulates depth on its own (without the aid of supplementary hardware such as the Super FX chip) using sprite scaling and rudimentary rendering. This system is able to run smoothly on standard SNES hardware because little more than half of the total screen area is ever in use. Since the top and bottom panels are completely static during overworld navigation, all hardware power is focused on rendering the first person view. Even so, framerates can suffer as many sprites are sometimes present on a single screen.",,,SNES,,Singleplayer,"Atari, Kotobuki System Co",KEMCO,1994

Renovate your Zoo!In Zoo Simulator, one of your first tasks will be to restore the zoo. You will have to put a lot of effort into cleaning neglected alleys and damaged places for your future animals. To do this, you will be using a lot of tools such as welders and water washers. Remember - hard work can result in a crowd of delighted visitors!
Various species of animalsThere is no Zoo without the animals living in it, right? In our game, you decide which of them will live in your facility. Remember that the more interesting the specimens live in your zoo, the more people will want to see them, which means more income for your business. Sit down to the computer and choose from the most exotic and amazing animals from around the world!
Arrange runs for animalsAnimals from the farthest corners of the world will appear in your zoo, they will also require appropriate living conditions - so you must take care of lairs, hiding places, and plants that will make them happy. There will be a lot of different elements in the game, which you will be able to freely move, position and rotate, thus creating unique zones for animals.
Look after themIn Zoo Simulator, you also need to take care of the well-being of your animals, which in return will repay you with peace, good health, and activity in their animal run. Feed them, look after them and pay special attention to their safety - animals love to nibble their nose wherever they have a chance to fit it! Thanks to this, animals will be more likely to show themselves to visitors and win their sympathy.
Develop your ZooAs you run your business, you will need to develop it as well. There will be more visitors, which means more attractions that will be able to make their time more pleasant. Take care of the right number of public toilets and sanitary facilities, rest areas filled with benches and eating places where they will be able to eat! Also, don't forget to buy interesting new animals. It is extremely important that guests do not want to leave your zoo and will invite their friends.",https://games-i.com/,,PC,"Adventure, Strategy, Simulation, Casual, Indie","Singleplayer, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Atmospheric, Open World, First-Person, Family Friendly, Cute, Colorful, Realistic, Management, Relaxing, Economy, Education, Immersive Sim, nature, Family Sharing, Life Sim","Games Incubator, C&E","PlayWay, Games Incubator, C&E",1994

You face a ""wall"" of tiles of different colors with some bombs and cans among them. Your goal is to clear out the wall. To make tiles disappear you need to double-tap on at least two tiles of the same color next to each other. The more tiles disappear at the same time, the higher your score is.
The top bonus row consists of randomly generated tiles accompanied by bombs. This row always floats from the right to the left side of the screen, occasionally falling down from time to time. You can slide the screen down or tap a bonus row item to drop the row when you need.
When the ""wall"" is narrower than the screen, you can move all the tiles from one screen side to the other to meet the bonus row when it falls. Bombs and cans are helpful: deleted cans add points to your score, exploded bombs destroy the tiles and cans around them.
As you remove all tiles of the same color, the bonus row will never give you tiles of this color at the current level. As soon as you clear the wall, a new level begins. The higher your level is, the more colors are used (up to 6), the faster the bonus row floats, and the more often it occasionally falls.

Most dungeons are procedurally generated, but once the game generates a dungeon, it does not change even if the player exits and re-enters it. (The Infinite Dungeon is an exception, however.)
Biskup ceased development of the game for nine years, but revisited it in 2012. He also resumed work on a sequel, Ancient Domains of Mystery II.

Many have failed in completing those games without help from a guide or a walkthrough, but those who accomplished this quest can be proud of it because here, being a hero really means something.
Each part of the series features very interesting and well told story. The combat is intuitive and fast, and the game mechanics are very easy to get into. So, if you want to test your cRPG skills or find out how they made games back then, this series is an excellent place to start your journey.

Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo's mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of ""Sonic"" and ""Mario"".
Somari was developed by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very little is known about the game's origins; it is theorized to have been based upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES.

The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.

Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.

From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication: Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).

Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.

Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.

While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same game, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.",,,Genesis,Adventure,"Dark, combat, character, ship, planet, planets, room, simple, ships",Spectrum Holobyte,Spectrum Holobyte,1994

You can choose one of 9 nations to represent in this game. You also get to play singles against a wide variety of opponents by choosing practice mode, quick match, or tournament. Practice your tennis skills first, then move onto a quick match which allows you to select your opponent (pick one of 4 fictional players) and the type of court surface (concrete, grass, clay). Finally move onto tournament mode where you can select a host city from around the world and start playing from the quarter-finals onto the final!
The action is viewed from a 3rd-person perspective, and the in-game graphics are 2D rotoscoped-animated sprites.
Original reviews of the game stated –
PC Gamer  – ‘But even with all its multimedia flash, International Tennis Open is first and foremost a fast-paced, challenging sports sim and a solid computer game, rivalled only by 1992's Jimmy Connors' Pro Tennis Tour. It's a shining example of what multimedia entertainment should be.’
PC Joker – ‘It is not for nothing that the version for the CD-i was awarded as the best European multimedia entertainment product - it is not for nothing that the International Tennis Open is now also at the top of the world rankings on the PC!’",,,PC,"Simulation, Sports","Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Third Person, Local Multiplayer, Retro, 2.5D, Tutorial, tennis","Infogrames, Infogrames Europe, Pathe Interactive","Philips Interactive Media, Pixel Games UK",1994

The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park, and hidden by him in twelve safes somewhere in the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).

The gameplay is fairly simple: using Yogi, the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen; to kill certain enemies the hero must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them; he has to avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.

There are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled ""1-UP"" that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When Yogi enters these safes, he must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold; collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.",,,Game Boy,Platformer,"Singleplayer, 2D, Retro, exclusive, true exclusive, bear, platformers, Platform, Game Boy, platformer-2d, adventures, vintage, yogi, yogi bear, cartoons, gb, bear-adventures, vintage-cartoons, long-play, retro-style",Twilight,"Sunsoft, GameTek",1994

The day quickly goes south when Employee 004 causes an explosion that endangers the world, her life and her new job.
Now it’s up to employee 004 to get to the center of the station to fix the problem that herself caused, for that task, N.Gineer, leads Employee 004 to the “Power Arm”
With the PowerArm you can activate electric panels that power all the elements in the station, allowing you to open doors, turn off security measures, or use the station elements to your advantage.

The main advantage of the power arm is that shooting it will literally launch you back with the gun recoil, this can be used to jump really high, allowing you to reach high places and far corners.
Could Employee 004 reach the center of the station on time?.

The game is set in a fictional medieval fantasy world and its story takes place on the continent of Aglia. Many primary and secondary characters are featured and eventually become controllable by the player, but the initial segment of the story begins in the small southern kingdom of Finice-Deal, focusing on a young knight who has completed his nobility initiation and must protect his country from hostile pagan worshipers.

The game is divided into scenarios, each built like a large-scale tactical battle that takes place in a location comprising outdoor areas and towns. The player navigates characters in real time on the overhead battle field in a point-and-click fashion, with enemies moving in real time as well. Each character represents a unit of a different type (such as knights, archers, magicians, etc., some with a general leading them). When a player-controlled and an AI-controlled unit are near each other the player can opt to view a full-screen animated battle sequence, the outcome of which is decided depending on the combatant's parameters. Like in regular RPGs, towns can be visited and establishments such as inns, shops and bars can be accessed (however, without free movement through the rest of the town). This can be done in the middle of the battle, provided a character is positioned near a town gate. Characters gain experience points, level up, and can equip a variety of weapons, armor and accessories.",,,PC,RPG,,,,1994

The manga is published in English by Viz Media. Only volumes 1–19 have been translated, with no plans to release the rest. Additionally, a six-part anime OVA was released in 1992.

Up to three T-MEK cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions. T-MEK was later ported to MS-DOS and the Sega 32X; rather than linking multiple systems together, the home versions featured split-screen multiplayer for two players.
T-MEK featured surround sound, which Time Warner Interactive advertised as ""CAGE Audio"". Each player's station had four speakers; two in front and two behind the player, and a subwoofer mounted directly below the seat. T-MEK has no background music soundtrack, which was a departure for ""deluxe"" arcade games in the coming-of-age era of digitally sampled audio, and instead relied upon the sound to help aid the player in finding enemies.",,,"SEGA 32X, PC",,Singleplayer,,Atari,1994

He led his armies of darkness on a swathe of destruction in search of his goal, and many years later found a great beast inhabiting a vast cavern protecting his prize. Ariath reached out to touch the Crystal Dragon and the guardian awoke. A fierce magical battle ensued between the two rivals. Ariath won by he could still not fulfill his dream; he summoned all his powers to create a magical fortress to study and gain the secret that the Crystal Dragon held.

Although Liberation was released for the Amiga computer, it was one of the few titles developed primarily with the Amiga CD32 in mind. Specifically, it features long cut-scenes, voice acting, and a CD-quality soundtrack - the title of which has been re-recorded by the original composer for the Amiga Immortal 4 remix CD.
The game has some similarities with Hired Guns; both games have a dark cyberpunk setting. However, the object of Liberation is to find and free a prisoner by gathering clues and following leads. The game world is a very large city containing hundreds of fully explorable households, offices and public buildings. This vast setting precludes a brute force approach to finding the captive, and gives rise to the core gameplay element of detective work.
In line with its nominal classification as a role-playing video game, Liberation features typical role-playing tropes such as inventories, character upgrades, shops, money, and banks. Almost all world features are interactive: the libraries contain large volumes of real information the player must use, the police enforce the law and have working police stations and cells, the taxis are functional, and the player can deal drugs with the drug dealers.",,,Commodore / Amiga,RPG,Singleplayer,Byte Engineers,MINDSCAPE,1994

One day the curious girl uses the wand; as a result, an evil demon is unleashed into the world. The spirit of the wand, a rabbit-like creature known as Sirius, tells Marble that it is now her responsibility to save the world from the demon, whose vile plan is to brainwash and sexually abuse ripe pretty young girls!

Marble Cooking is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The game consists of seven stages; each stage has one-screen levels. Marble is inserted into the level, with hostile creatures of various kinds (ghosts, books, demons, gangsters, brooms, etc.) wandering around her; the girl dies if any of the creatures touches her.

The only way to defeat the creatures is through summoning Sirius. First, it is necessary to place a line of carrots on the floor. At any time afterwards, the player can call Sirius by pressing a button; the rabbit will then re-trace the carrot line, stopping where it ends. The goal is to time all this in such a way that the hostile creatures will collide with the running rabbit, leading to their demise.

The levels get more complex as the game progresses, with room layouts (corridors, angles, and so on) working against Marble, more aggressive creatures with hard-to-predict movement patterns, etc.
