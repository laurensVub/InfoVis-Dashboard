One of the classic representatives of the first-person shooter genre. Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.

###Key features
In a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake.

Players take control of characters from the Mario franchise, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user.

The story follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he embarks on a journey to save the Flickies, a species of bird that are being enslaved by Doctor Robotnik. The player must guide Sonic through a series of themed levels to collect Flickies, in order to defeat Robotnik. Though it shares similar gameplay elements with prior Sonic the Hedgehog games, Sonic 3D Blast is differentiated by its isometric viewpoint, making occasional use of pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites.
While the game was conceived by Sonic Team, most of the actual programming was outsourced to Traveller's Tales. Produced as a swan song for the Genesis, Sonic 3D Blast was developed alongside the unreleased Saturn game Sonic X-treme. When X-treme was canceled, Sega commissioned a port of 3D Blast for the Saturn as a backup plan. Both versions were published by Sega in November 1996, and the game was ported to Microsoft Windows the following year. Sonic 3D Blast was the final Sonic game for the Genesis, and has been rereleased on numerous Sonic themed compilations and digital distribution platforms.
Though a commercial success, becoming the second bestselling Saturn game behind Nights into Dreams, Sonic 3D Blast received mixed reviews from critics. Reviewers generally disliked its isometric gameplay, citing frustrations with its controls and slow pace, but praised its visuals and music. An unofficial director's cut version developed by the Genesis version's lead programmer, Jon Burton, was released in 2017. It features new gameplay features and improved graphics and controls, among other changes.",,,"PC, Wii, SEGA Saturn, Genesis, GameCube",Arcade,Singleplayer,"Traveller's Tales, Sonic Team",SEGA,1996

Hidehiko Uesugi talks all of his friends into playing a game called ""Persona"", which is played much like the ritual game ""Bloody Mary"". While playing, the students lose consciousness and meet Philemon, who gives them the ability to summon reflections of their personalities, which are known as Personas.

A short time later, the protagonist and several of his friends go to visit Maki Sonomura, who is ill and bed-ridden. During their visit, they discover that the town is changing and demons are roaming the streets. The party is told by Maki's mother, an engineer working for SEBEC, that the culprit behind the incident is Takahisa Kandori, president of the company.

After taking Maki's mother to the school (the only place in town safe from demons), the protagonist's actions decide the course of the story. If the protagonist opts for going after Kandori, it'll start the SEBEC Chapter which is the main storyline of the game.

What's there not to like about teams of 10 worms unleashing hell against each other on a fully destructible map using a wide arsenal of fun and imaginative weapons? The answer is ""nothing"". Especially if you are using the multiplayer option. The look on your buddy's face when your well-placed holy grenade sends a bunch of his best worm-soldiers to a better place is just priceless.
Creative use of weapons is the key to victory. You can shoot the bazooka directly at your opponent and take some of his health. If you are clever and skilled, though, then maybe there is a way to use the wind and gravity to curve the trajectory of the projectile so that it lands right behind his cover and throws him from the cliff, causing an instant death? The feeling of satisfaction after such a brilliantly executed stunt is what makes this game great. So if you are looking for a game to play with your friends then you really can’t go wrong with Worms United.Worms United includes Worms and Worms: Reinforcements

Two cosmic forces, called God and Devil by the humans, were fighting each other fiercely until their final battle in Antarctica led to a catastrophe: the continents of the surface world submerged into the ocean, presumably eradicating all life on the Lightside.

Meanwhile, the isolated underworld, consisting of frozen crystal mountains and lava rivers, continues to exist. A young boy named Ark grew up in Crysta, the only remaining village on the Darkside. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark inadvertently causes all the villagers to be turned into stones. In order to bring them back to life, Ark has to find five towers within the dangerous Darkside and eventually restore life on the surface of the planet.

Terranigma is an action role-playing game. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using different techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc., resulting from the combination of three basic actions - attacking, running, and jumping. Special objects called Magirocks can be collected and converted into rings, which act as one-use items capable of casting magic spells.

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski on a variety of courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.
Originally referred to as ""F-Zero on water"", the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities. However, these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. Wave Race 64 received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the game's satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited for helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities.

It was directed by Hayato Kaji, who had previously worked on the series as an artist. Keiji Inafune, who was also an artist for the series, was given the role of producer after the departure of Tokuro Fujiwara who had been producer for the series since Mega Man 2. It is the eighth installment in original Mega Man series, and was originally released in Japan on the PlayStation in 1996. The following year, Mega Man 8 saw a release on the Sega Saturn and was localized for both consoles in North America and the PlayStation alone in PAL regions. Upon its release, Capcom reached the franchise's tenth anniversary. Mega Man 8 is the first game in the series made available on 32-bit consoles.
The plot begins as the robotic hero Mega Man is called to investigate a mysterious energy reading coming from a recent meteor crash on an island. Mega Man discovers that his nemesis Dr. Wily has beaten him there and immediately retreats with the energy source. Mega Man is charged with stopping Wily's evil plans to use the energy, as well as discover the purpose of a mysterious, alien robot found at the crash site. Along with new animated full-motion videos (FMVs) and voice acting, Mega Man 8 features improved graphics and sound when compared to previous iterations in the series. Aside from a few minor conventions, the game utilizes the same 2D side-scrolling and platforming formula established by its predecessors on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems.
Many reviewers appreciated the aesthetic and gameplay qualities of Mega Man 8 when compared to its earlier counterparts. However, several other critics were displeased by this same lack of innovation, finding that it does not utilize the full potential of the 32-bit platforms; additionally, the English-language version of the game received considerable criticism for its voice acting, which was perceived by many as being comically poor-quality. This resulted in an overall average or mixed critical reception. However, the game was a moderate commercial success and was re-released on best-seller lines in both Japan and North America. Mega Man 8 was followed by Mega Man & Bass, a 1998 spin-off game for the SNES and later Game Boy Advance. A true sequel to the game, Mega Man 9, would not be released until 2008 and would revert to the graphical and gameplay style of the early NES games.",,,"SEGA Saturn, PlayStation",Action,Singleplayer,Capcom,"Capcom, Ocean Software, PAL, Infogrames Multimedia, Computer and Video Games, page=81, issn=0261-3697, title=''Mega Man 8'', EMAP, author=Lomas, Ed, date=October 1997, issue=191",1996

It is the first entry in the Persona series, itself a subseries of the Megami Tensei franchise, and the first role-playing entry in the series to be released in the west. Originally released for the PlayStation in 1996 in Japan and North America, the title was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1999. A port to the PlayStation Portable retitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was released in North America and Japan in 2009, and the following year in Europe. This port featured new cutscenes and a reworked English localization.
The story focuses on a group of high school students as they are confronted by a series of supernatural incidents. After playing a fortune-telling game, the group each gain the ability to summon Personas, the multiple selves within them. Using this power under the guidance of Philemon, a benevolent being representing humanity's subconscious, the group face off against multiple forces that threaten the world. Gameplay revolves around the characters navigating environments around their town and fighting enemies using their Personas. During the course of the game, the player can create new Personas for battle using spell cards gained in battle or by talking with enemies.
Persona began development after the release of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized.

While the overall plot remains true to the original, accommodations are made to the game's story to allow for a larger, richer cast, as well as additional scenarios.
Initially released on the Sega Saturn in 1996, the game has gone through several variations, beginning with enhanced video support in conjunction with the Saturn's MPEG graphics add-on in 1997, and later being ported to Sony's PlayStation in 1998. The PlayStation version was released in North America by Working Designs, who had also produced the English adaptation of the original game, in May 1999.
Like its forerunner, the game follows the exploits of Alex, a young boy from a small, humble town who enters a life of adventure and intrigue after being chosen as the heir-apparent to the title of ""Dragonmaster"", guardian of the forces of the planet. With the help of his expanding band of companions, Alex must pass the trials set by ancient dragons to claim his place in history, and stop a powerful sorcerer and former hero from controlling the world.

According to staff, Jugdral is within the same world as Archanea, the continent featured in the original Fire Emblem and its sequels: the events of Genealogy of the Holy War are set hundreds of years prior to the time period of Archanea, with the latter being in a barely civilized state. It was during this time that the Dragon Tribes were debating how to treat humanity. In ancient times in the year Grann 440, the Earth Dragon Loptyr made a pact with the priest Galle, who becomes his vessel for bringing ruin to humanity. By 632, the Divine Dragon Naga had discovered Loptyr's part in the gradual conquest of Jugdral, so she chose twelve soldiers to defeat Loptyr: this event became known as the Miracle of Darna. The Twelve Crusaders defeated Loptyr and his cult, bringing peace to the land in a conflict dubbed the ""Holy War"" — these twelve would go on to establish Jugdral's countries.

It is Capcom's third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters, following X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, and the first installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. As the title suggests, the game includes characters from Marvel's X-Men franchise and the cast from Capcom's Street Fighter series. Originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996, it was eventually ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and the PlayStation in 1998.
X-Men vs. Street Fighter features gameplay similar to Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters to compete in a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.
The game was released to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise for maintaining the experience of the original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles. The changes were done in response to the technical limitations of the PlayStation.

The hardware consisted of a TMS32031 CPU clocked at 50 MHz, an ADSP-2115 DSP clocked at 10 MHz for sound and a custom 3D chip that could render perspective-correct but unfiltered quads at a high resolution (512 x 400 pixels).
Along with Killer Instinct, it was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo 64. Neither game made it out for Nintendo 64's launch, however.

You will be able to manage and monitor your creature for a single season.
This is a simulator game with an emphasis on simulation. You have considerable freedom to create creatures and set environmental parameters. When the season begins, your action is limited to modify the behavior algorithm. You will get detailed statistics to analyze every day. The most successful species will be selected at the end of the season.
Environment setup
You can define environmental and seasonal parameters such as map size, season length, food abundance, number of other creatures, and more.
There is only one type of environment in Early Access. Full Release will also have swamp and desert terrains.
Creature setup
You can design your own creature or choose from presets and save your creature to the library. You will be able to customize the appearance of your creature and spend points on abilities to increase survivability. Body size, mouthpart, food range, eyesight, bowel system, leg muscles, energy consumption, reproduction, skin, and fat are all important factors to consider.
The season
During the season all creatures try to do their best to survive. They hunt, forage, hide, escape, reproduce, or search for abundant areas.

The game was co-developed by Nintendo (primarily Nintendo EAD, who developed the original game) and the American visual technology group Paradigm Simulation. It was one of three launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America. Pilotwings 64 is a follow-up to Pilotwings for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991. Also like that game, Pilotwings 64 received production input from Nintendo producer and EAD General Manager Shigeru Miyamoto.
Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight simulator that puts the player in control of one of six pilots as they try to earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.
The game received positive review scores and praise from gaming publications and news sources alike for its visual presentation and flying controls. Similar to its SNES predecessor, Pilotwings 64 serves to demonstrate the graphical capabilities of its gaming hardware. Although the flight simulator did not enjoy the same commercial success as its fellow launch game Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 nonetheless went on to sell over one million copies worldwide.",,,Nintendo 64,Simulation,"Singleplayer, exclusive, true exclusive","Nintendo, Paradigm Simulation",Nintendo,1996

The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Characters—including a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatale—fight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.
Rare was a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo in the 1990s, and their Killer Instinct series was produced as an exclusive partnership in response to the popularity of Mortal Kombat. Following the success of the 1995 Killer Instinct port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Rare began a sequel for the same platform but transitioned development to its successor, the Nintendo 64, upon its unveiling. Gold was scheduled as a launch title for the new console but was delayed until its North American release in November 1996. It was released in other regions in May 1997. Gold was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.
Reviewers preferred the Nintendo 64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient when compared to fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system and the absence of several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.",,,Nintendo 64,Fighting,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, exclusive, true exclusive",Rare,Nintendo,1996

You might think that this job is mostly digging holes and dusting old bones. How could a game about that possibly be fun? Well, Lara Croft is anything but an ordinary archaeologist and her life is anything but boring. Lara Croft, tomb raider, occupies an interesting niche between Indiana Jones and Bayonetta: she’s a relic hunter who can kick butt and take names with the best of them.
When Lara ventures into ancient tombs in search for legendary treasures and forgotten knowledge, she must keep in mind that those responsible for safeguarding those artifacts didn’t leave them unguarded. The tombs are filled with deadly traps, bizarre monsters, and clever puzzles. Lara is not all looks, though, so she’s ready for the dangers that await. At her disposal is an arsenal of weapons from twin pistols, through all kinds of machine guns and assault rifles, all the way to grenade launchers and bazookas.
In the first game, Lara seeks a powerful artifact--the Scion--that seems to be the key to finding the mythical island of Atlantis. In the second game of the series our sexy archaeologist follows the trial of the mystical Dagger of Xian, which is a weapon used by the first Emperor of China, and it is said that by plunging the dagger into one's heart, the bearer turns into a dragon. The third part features non-linear gameplay, meaning you can choose not only the way in which you complete a level, but also your next destination in the story. Here, you fight against an evil corrupt corporation--RX Tech-- that has come into possession of a strange meteorite apparently imbued with unique properties.
Fans of action platformers, great stories, and timeless classics: good news! You don’t have to plunder any long-forgotten crypts to pick up the phenomenal Tomb Raider games: get them here on GOG.com instead.

It was developed by Japanese company Compile and released on February 23, 1996 in Japan only as both the last Mega-CD game released in Japan and the last game released anywhere on the Mega-CD/Sega CD.
The game has a 1990s manga-based visual style loosely based on a contemporary Japanese manga series which was based on the Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there are no characters of those races in this game. The combat system is turn-based, and six-sided dice appear rolling on the screen determine the results of combat—the conflict resolution system used in the Shadowrun table-top game.",,,SEGA CD,"Adventure, RPG","Singleplayer, exclusive",Compile,Compile,1996

Humans reached the stars long ago, building a Republic of high technology and universal emancipation—and then squandered it, fought over it, and finally lost it.
A New Dark Age has descended upon humanity, for the greatest of civilizations has fallen and now even the stars are dying. Feudal lords rule the Known Worlds, vying for power with fanatic priests and scheming guilds.
A grand 4X strategy game developed by Holistic Design Inc., Emperor of the Fading Suns is set in the Dark Ages of Space. It allows players to take the role of one of the powerful nobles fighting to become Emperor of the Known Worlds. Similar to such strategy classics as Civilization and Masters of Orion, Emperor of the Fading Suns offers a sophisticated diplomacy engine, space and ground combat, discovery of new planets, multi-player (Internet) competition and more. While rushed to market, it built a loyal following and spawned numerous, unofficial fan-made mods.
In 4550 AD, Vladimir I, the first Emperor of the Known Worlds, crowned himself with his own hands and by the Grace of Holy Terra. He was dead within moments. The Regency is vacant and all humanity is preparing to elect a new Regent. But times are changing.
The mysterious fading of all the suns of the Known Worlds is accelerating, causing increased hardship and a general sense of foreboding. The Fading Suns are a portent, it is said, of coming Armageddon.
Each of the Royal Houses can trace its ancestry to the time of Grand Emperor Vladimir, who consolidated the fragments of the Second Republic into one might Imperium. As ordered by the Great Charter, in the event of an Emperor's death, human space was to be ruled by an interim Regent. However, no Regent has been able to harness enough power to declare himself Emperor. In the meanwhile, the Regency has become a means to loot the Imperium.
Many feel that the human race needs strong, dedicated leadership to face the uncertain future - a selfless leader willing to take a personal interest in the fate of the Imperium. But the Regent has been a mere figurehead, who can at most discourage inter-human conflict. Humanity's only solution is to make the position of Regent a hereditary one, to once again have it called by its ancient name - Emperor. Then the future of the entire Empire will be the overriding concern of the Emperor, instead of just the short-sighted good of his own House.
Can you lead your noble house, be it selfless Hawkwood, debauched Decados, scheming al-Malik, pious Li Halan or militant Hazat, to final victory? Will you return humanity to its once-shining glory? Dare you to become Emperor of the Fading Suns?

Robbit must explore each expansive new world to recapture all the lost Muu Muus. As with its predecessor, the game is presented in a first-person perspective. Much of the interface was transferred from the first Jumping Flash! to the second in order to save time during development. New features include a much longer draw distance, updated enemy AI and a meter displaying whether or not Robbit can triple-jump.
Similar to its predecessor, Jumping Flash! 2 was well received by critics, who praised the game for its updated interface, advanced graphics and gameplay. However, also like its predecessor, it was criticised for its short length, lack of challenging gameplay and close similarities to the first game.

The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from Bubble Bobble.
The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.
Some versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.
Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble.

As civilization advanced, those who possessed the power of technology and magic segregated due to their differences in ideas and formed two separate societies of humans and demons.
The human race continued to develop their civilization with technology, while the demons started to construct their own society with magic.
This balance did not hold for very long, however, and technology was gradually replacing magic.
Soon afterwards, an ultimate weapon from the technological civilization appeared, and in an ironic twist of fate, lost control and destroyed the whole world, along with all civilization therein.
Nearly a thousand years have gone by without incident, until one day the ancient technology lying deep within the Earth was excavated.
Mankind was once again on its way to committing the same mistakes of the past…
Since long ago, the world has stood by four mysterious temples controlling the forces of nature, each protecting a kingdom.
The Cruz Kingdom governs the water with the Moon Temple. It paints a beautiful picture of a land covered in water.
The bold Galien Kingdom emerges as a tropical desert climate near the Sun Temple. It is a unified, intrepid kingdom.
In the polar regions is the Zak Empire. Its technical research has flourished with the power of the Star Temple.

In addition, much of the team's roster was changed, including its goalie, Tim Cheveldae being replaced by Nikolai Khabibulin, therefore Cheveldae was unable to be a goalie playing for any team in the PlayStation version.

The PlayStation version was released by Acclaim in North America and PAL regions. The game is a 3D fighter which combines the normal features of an arcade fighting game with psychic powers. There are eight playable characters and a final boss who is playable through the use of a code. Psychic Force was released without much hype and was not commercially successful. Psychic Force would later get an arcade-exclusive update titled Psychic Force EX, which was released a year later in 1996. EX made the final boss playable without using a code, added new color schemes for the costumes, and improved and balanced the gameplay. In 1998, a sequel was released under the title Psychic Force 2012 also for the arcade, and was ported to the Dreamcast console in 1999. It was eventually adapted to the PlayStation under the title Psychic Force 2, which was released in Japan on October 7, 1999 and later to the PAL regions in 2001.
In 2006, the original Psychic Force was re-released as part of as an anniversary pack for the PlayStation 2 titled Psychic Force Complete, which had included Psychic Force 2012 and a special exclusive remixed version of 2012 titled Psychic Force 2012 EX.",,,PlayStation,Fighting,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer",Taito,"Taito, Acclaim",1996

The game draws players to guide Hayate with a joystick for moving him around and one button for using weapons through 15 different stages that take place in feudal Japan-based areas. There are three difficulty levels.
Like earlier laserdisc games such as Don Bluth's Dragon's Lair, Ninja Hayate contains traps and creatures that requires players to dodge or attack them at specific moments, by watching for the warning buzzer (like Dragon's Lair) in addition to flashing objects (e.g. arrows, buttons, light, etc.). If a player makes a mistake, one life decreases, and when players run out of lives, the game ends.
Unlike Don Bluth's laserdisc games, Ninja Hayate is animated with anime drawings by Toei Animation. Another difference is that the game flashes the buttons that need to be pressed directly on the screen.

You are playing as the yellow guy called spark. You wake up at an unknown place which seems to be caught in a loop of time. Your goal is to break the loop by reaching the exit portal in time. But every time the timer runs out the map is reset, and you start again at your spawn portal. Your actions do not go to waste though. A ghost appears and repeats all your moves done previously, interacting with certain elements in the world, effectively allowing you to be at multiple places at the same time. Some elements interact with both, you and your ghosts, while others only seem to exist in one of these dimensions. Use that to your advantage by sending your ghosts to things that you could not accomplish yourself. Break the rules of what seems impossible. But always remember that time is of the essence.FEATURES

You fly around with a super-fast rocket between your legs. You fire cables from your rocket at pylons to turn and to clothesline your opponents (preferably really good friends, who take losing badly).
You knock them off their rockets. You steal their rockets. You plow them over, repeatedly, with their own rockets. Then, you snag them with your cables and you drag them along the ground, bashing them into walls and things. As if this wasn’t already Nirvana, the soundtrack features the legendary surf guitar rockin’ Dick Dale!ModesRocket Ball
Croquet, it ain’t. Try latching onto different kinds of balls, some that bounce…others that explode! Heave them into the goal or at other jockeys! All while they try to turn your head into pudding pie!
Rocket Racing
Makes drag racing look like bingo. Rocket around the arena, cutting between pylons, smacking fellow jockeys into the wall and out of the race. All while avoiding oncoming walls. To win, you need a strategy. A twisted, demented, crackbrained, sicko strategy, but a strategy nonetheless!
Rocket War
Last one on a rocket wins! More importantly though, said winner, gets to scream in the losers’ faces. Isn’t that what it’s all about?! Clothesline opponents, drag them along the ground at speeds over 100 MPH, plow them over, torch them with jet exhaust and absolutely crush them against the hood of your rocket! All’s fair in love and war…and we ain’t talkin’ bout’ love! We’re rotten to the core!

Plot
Jack Fremont is known for his knowledge of TV shows; it turns out life is rough right now. He is about to get kicked out of his house. However, when bragging about his knowledge he is confronted by CIA agents. They tell him that there is a terrorist on the loose who wants to blow up Los Angeles. The terrorist is uncredited in some TV shows and now it's up to Jack to stop him.[1]

Gameplay
The gameplay of this game is varied. In some places the player character explores rooms and finds objects, and in others he enters fighting and action sequences. There is time limit in many of these sequences.[2] A red box in the corner of the screen informs the player when they need to take action during a quick time event.[3]

Development
Fox Hunt was developed on a budget of $2 million.[4] Development was largely handled by movie studio 3Vision, with writer/producer Matt Pyken, producer/lawyer Adam Berns, and director Michael Berns (Adam's brother) at the helm.[4] The Pyken/Berns/Berns trio had previously created the 1994 PC game National Lampoon's Blind Date.[4]

Casting for the game was conducted in the second quarter of 1995.[4] The game was filmed over 35 days, mostly at the former Ambassador Hotel, though four days were set aside for shooting skiing footage in Aspen, Colorado.[4] George Lazenby commented on the shooting schedule: ""Actors need a lot of flexibility since scenes are shot so quickly and you instantly go from being good to being evil. As Bond [in On Her Majesty's Secret Service], I once waited three days while the crew prepared to film a single scene! On Fox Hunt we do a new scene every hour. It's the way movies should be made.""[4]

Reception
Reception for this game was positive. GameSpot said this about the game: ""Overlooking some of the childish antics of its hero, Capcom's Fox Hunt is an interactive movie that merits more than a showing or two. It's silly and amusing but surprisingly well developed and fun to play."" and gave it a 6.8.[5]",,,PlayStation,Adventure,,,Capcom,1996

Released for the Amiga 1200 and Amiga CD32, the game was heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda series, with other influences including Secret of Mana and The Secret of Monkey Island. The plot involves an inheritance dispute between two princes—Gallus and Kale—in which the former murders his brother to secure his position as king. However, Kale had secretly made a pact with his friend, Cho, that would place him as king should Kale be murdered. Players assume the role of Cho, and adventure throughout the land of Speris.
The Speris Legacy met with mediocre critical reception. Amiga Format's Steve McGill, while praising the game's graphics, described its gameplay as ""relentless tedium"", and gave it a score of 69%. Martin Davies of CU Amiga complained that the game's lack of hints regarding the player's goals results in ""endless meandering"" and frustration, and scored it 74%.",,,Commodore / Amiga,,Singleplayer,Binary Emotions,Team17 Digital,1996

Unlike its predecessor, Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 is exclusive to the Super Famicom console.

The goal of the game is to create a means to get a small bald character to each level's exit. They can do this by stacking falling blocks Tetris-style to form stairs to the exit, but they can also let this character walk on top of a still-active block and move that block across the screen to the exit. The player can make use of a number of power-ups as they fall down the screen in lieu of the usual blocks. The character must escape before the stage floods. Two players can also compete to reach the exit first, dropping traps on their opponent to slow them down.

The game makes a few significant changes to the original Super Gussun Oyoyo. The most apparent of which is its new setting of a tropical island with an active volcano: many stages will start dropping fireballs the longer the player takes, which must be avoided at all costs. The game also features a new ""Puzzle Mode"" which plays similarly to those found in Tetris sequels: the player has a limited number of pre-determined pieces and must figure out how to use them to get their little bald friend to the end.",,,SNES,"Action, Puzzle",,,Banpresto,1996
