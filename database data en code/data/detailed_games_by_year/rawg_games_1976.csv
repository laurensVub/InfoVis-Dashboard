52402,breakout-1976,Breakout (1976),1976-01-01,,3.28,22,0,58,0,0,"Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc., released on May 13, 1976. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs. The game was ported to multiple platforms and upgraded to video games such as Super Breakout. In addition, Breakout was the basis and inspiration for certain aspects of the Apple II personal computer.
In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.",,,"Atari ST, Atari Flashback, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation, Atari 2600, Commodore / Amiga",Arcade,"Singleplayer, Multiplayer, 2 players, alternating turns",Atari,"Atari, Namco",1976
54997,colossal-cave-adventure,Colossal Cave Adventure,1976-01-01,,3.5,9,0,48,0,0,"Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure) is a text adventure game, developed originally in 1976, by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in 1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.
In the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther's background as a caving enthusiast, with the game's cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky.
Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards the role playing and roguelike genres.",,,"Android, PC, Atari ST, Commodore / Amiga",Adventure,"Singleplayer, Interactive Fiction, Text-Based, text-adventure","Willie Crowther, Wolfgang Strobl, Don Woods, William Crowther",Wolfgang Strobl,1976
