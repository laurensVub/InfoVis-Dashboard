Russell served as the primary programmer, receiving valuable assistance from individuals such as Bob Saunders and Steve Piner. Initially designed for the newly installed DEC PDP-1 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Spacewar! quickly transcended its origins.

The game's expansion went beyond the efforts of its original developers, involving contributions from other students and professionals in the academic realm, including notable names like Dan Edwards and Peter Samson. What began as a project at MIT soon became a landmark in the history of video games.

Following its inception, Spacewar! not only captivated the MIT community but also spread to numerous PDP-1 computer installations across academic institutions. This widespread adoption marked Spacewar! as the first-known video game to be experienced at multiple computer installations, solidifying its place in the annals of gaming history.",,,,Arcade,"2D, Retro, Space, 2-players",Steve Russell,Steve Russell,1962
